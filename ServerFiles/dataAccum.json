    "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Desert Strike: Return to the Gulf is an isometric helicopter shoot 'em up from Electronic Arts. The player is a fighter pilot who must take down mission-critical targets across a number of maps. The player is free to pursue these missions in any order, and must also keep an eye on the fuel, damage, and ammo gauges.</p><p>Desert Strike is the first of the prolific <a href=\"/strike-series/3025-143/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-143\">Strike</a> series, and was followed with <a href=\"/jungle-strike/3030-2180/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2180\">Jungle Strike</a> and <a href=\"/urban-strike/3030-9336/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-9336\">Urban Strike</a> on the Genesis. Two more games, <a href=\"/soviet-strike/3030-2422/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2422\">Soviet Strike</a> and <a href=\"/nuclear-strike/3030-11731/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11731\">Nuclear Strike</a>, were released later for 32-bit systems.</p><h2>Story</h2><p>A year after the Gulf War, General Ibn Kilbaba takes over a small <a href=\"/unnamed-middle-eastern-location/3035-179/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-179\">Arab emirate</a> and plans to start World War III. Using an <a href=\"/ah-64-apache/3055-2463/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-2463\">AH-64 Apache</a>, the player must open the way for ground troops and finally take on the \"Madman\" himself.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>The game is played from an isometric perspective in open levels that allow free movement in all directions by scrolling the screen with the movement of the helicopter. Each level consists of many varying objectives that range anywhere from destroying enemy bases and vehicles to capturing enemy troops or rescuing friendly ones. While bases and vehicles are simply destroyed, both friendly and enemy troops must be taken back to base for extraction. The AH-64 Apache has limited cargo space, so multiple trips to and from the base may be necessary. These objectives aren't always linear, and can often be tackled in whatever order the player chooses. This combination of free movement and non-linear structure separated Desert Strike from many of the other contemporary shooters.</p><p>There are three weapons of varying strength and usefulness available to the AH-64 Apache: machine guns, hydra missiles, and hellfire missiles, which increase in strength respectively. Each of these weapons has a limited number of ammo which can only be replenished by picking up ammo crates on the mission or by resupplying back at the base. Similarly, the AH-64 Apache only has a limited amount of fuel that will drain slowly over the course of each level. If the fuel runs out, the helicopter crashes and the player loses a life. Refueling works exactly the same as restocking ammo.</p><p>Lives are lost when either the AH-64 Apache takes too much damage and is destroyed, or when it runs out of fuel. After three lives have been lost, the game is over. Due to the nature of the game's freedom, each level requires a certain amount of planning and strategy in order to complete all of the objectives while still having enough fuel, ammo, and health to survive.</p><h2>Ports</h2><p>Due to its popularity on the <a href=\"/sega-genesis/3055-4659/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-4659\">Sega Genesis</a> in 1992, the game was then ported to the <a href=\"/amiga/3045-1/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-1\">Amiga</a>, <a href=\"/sega-master-system/3045-8/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-8\">Master System</a>, and <a href=\"/snes/3045-9/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-9\">SNES</a> in the same year. Two years later in 1994, it was released on the <a href=\"/pc/3045-94/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">PC</a>. It was also ported to most handheld systems such as the <a href=\"/lynx/3045-7/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-7\">Lynx</a> in 1993, <a href=\"/game-gear/3045-5/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-5\">Game Gear</a> in 1994, <a href=\"/game-boy/3045-3/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-3\">Game Boy</a> in 1995, <a href=\"/game-boy-advance/3045-4/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-4\">Game Boy Advance</a> in 2002, and finally the <a href=\"/psp/3045-18/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-18\">PSP</a> in 2006 as part of <a href=\"/ea-replay/3030-10965/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-10965\">EA Replay</a>.</p>",

    "deck": "Smackdown Vs. Raw 2007 is the third installment in the Smackdown Vs. Raw series.",
    "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Smackdown Vs. Raw 2007 is a wrestling game developed by <a href=\"/yukes-co-ltd/3010-16/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-16\">Yuke's</a> and published by <a href=\"/thq/3010-15/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-15\">THQ</a> on November 14th 2006. Smackdown Vs. Raw 2007 is the third game in WWE's <a href=\"/wwe-smackdown-vs-raw/3025-1372/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1372\">Smackdown Vs. Raw</a> franchise. Smackdown Vs. Raw 2007 was the first game in the series to be released on a non-<a href=\"/sony-computer-entertainment-america/3010-313/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-313\">Sony</a> console.</p><p>WWE SmackDown! vs. RAW 2007 was originally planned to also be released on the <a href=\"/playstation-3/3045-35/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-35\">PlayStation 3 </a>platform, but was ultimately cancelled before release.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>New Features</h3><p>Smackdown vs Raw 2007 introduced the analog grappling system to the series, allowing the player to grapple using the right analog stick. Using the stick alone would do a weak grapple, while using RB(R1 for PS2) together with the right stick would cause the player's wrestler to hold the opponent in a grapple hold. Moving the right analog stick again makes the player's wrestler perform a grapple move.</p><p>Another new feature brought to Smackdown Vs. Raw 2007 is the fact that a characters move set changes depending on the weight class assigned to them. Also new to Smackdown vs Raw 2007 are environmental grapples. These environment hot spots allow the player to perform moves in a quick time event style control scheme that uses a specific place or item.</p><h3>Momentum</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/103881/1759121-stamina.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1759121\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 290px\" data-ratio=\"0.59655172413793\" data-width=\"290\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:59.7%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/103881/1759121-stamina.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1759121\"><img alt=\"Momentum Meter\" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/10/103881/1759121-stamina.jpg\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/10/103881/1759121-stamina.jpg 290w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 290px) 100vw, 290px\" data-width=\"290\"></a><figcaption>Momentum Meter</figcaption></figure><p>Smackdown Vs. Raw 2007 uses a momentum system for it's finishing maneuvers. The momentum meter will fluctuate back and forth depending on how well the player is doing in the match. If the player can pull off multiple types of moves in succession the momentum meter will rise quickly, however getting hit by the opponents moves will lower the meter. The characters attribute of clean or dirty will make a difference as to which moves will build the momentum meter quickly. Performing the same move repeatedly will make the players momentum meter fall.</p><h3>Location Specific Damage</h3><p>In Smackdown Vs. Raw 2007 a player can target individual body parts. There is a graphic on the top of the screen that shows a silhouette of a wrestler for each player. As damage on a specific body part increases it will change color on the silhouette.</p><h3>Stamina</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/103881/1759124-stamina2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1759124\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 290px\" data-ratio=\"0.5551724137931\" data-width=\"290\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:55.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/103881/1759124-stamina2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1759124\"><img alt=\"Stamina Meter\" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/10/103881/1759124-stamina2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/10/103881/1759124-stamina2.jpg 290w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 290px) 100vw, 290px\" data-width=\"290\"></a><figcaption>Stamina Meter</figcaption></figure><p>Each player has a stamina meter located near the location damage image. If a player is using moves continuously without a break the stamina meter will drop. If the stamina meter drops all the way down the player will not be able to move for a short period of time. The stamina meter will replenish on it's own over time while not using any attacks.</p><h2>Game Modes</h2><p>WWE Smackdown Vs. Raw 2007 features several different game modes including many improvements over Smackdown Vs. Raw 2006.</p><h3>Exhibition</h3><p>Exhibition mode is the customizable, one match mode. Exhibition mode does not affect the players other modes and can be tweaked to choose the match type, modifiers, characters, arena, and can be played by two human players.</p><h3>Season</h3><p>In season mode the player chooses a character and will play through a season. Throughout the season players will be involved in story lines which will change slightly depending on how the player performs in the matches.</p><h3>GM (General Manager)</h3><p>In GM mode the player assumes the role of the general manager on one of the brands competing against the general manager of the other brand. GM mode lasts for one in game year and the goal is to win GM of the Year award at the end of the year. In the role of GM the player can make trades, sign free agents, set up shows, initiate story lines, and more.</p><h3>PPV (Pay-Per-View)</h3><p>In Pay Per View mode the player creates a pay per view show. The player chooses the matches on the card, what kind of matches, and arena the event takes place in.</p><h3>Locker Room</h3><p>The locker room is mainly used throughout a season mode, but can be used at other times. The locker room is where the player can go to do thing such as: adjust wrestler attributes, visit the WWE Shop, check the trophy/belt case, and view the challenges.</p><h3>Online</h3><p>Online mode is where the player would go to play Smackdown Vs. Raw 2007 online. The online mode is much like exhibition mode in single player, but instead it is against other human opponents over the internet. In order to play the online mode on the PS2 version of the game the online adapter must be attached.</p><h2>Roster</h2><table><tbody><tr><th>Raw Superstars</th><th>Smackdown

    "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Super Spy Hunter, or Battle Formula, is a vertical-scrolling vehicular combat game that plays similarly to <a href=\"/spy-hunter/3030-10448/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-10448\">Spy Hunter</a>. The player is driving a morphing combat vehicle capable of numerous weapon loadouts, acquired by destroying trucks carrying power-ups. These power-ups increase the firepower of the player's car, as well as extending their life bar and other bonuses.</p><p>The game has an unusual cheat built in: If the player configures the cursor on the continue menu (found after losing all their lives), they can play a fast-paced game of Pong against a CPU opponent. If they win, they resume the game with 20 lives instead of the usual five. If they lose, they resume with zero extra lives.</p><p>For its US release, SunSoft acquired the Spy Hunter license and promoted the game as a Spy Hunter sequel, but the game wasn't initially affiliated with Spy Hunter in any way. The game is a collector's item in Japan, fetching high prices.</p><p> </p>",

Metal Slug X was developed by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-616\" href=\"/snk-playmore/3010-616/\">SNK Playmore</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3010-3660\" href=\"/nazca-corporation/3010-3660/\">Nazca Corporation</a>, and published by SNK Playmore. Not only did it fix slowdown problems present in Metal Slug 2, but it increased the difficulty. New weapons and items were also added, such as the Iron Lizard and the Drop Shot. In addition to these changes, enemy placement and bosses were also changed. Metal Slug X was later ported to the Neo Geo AES (in 1999) and the PlayStation (in 2001).</p><h2>New Weapons</h2><ul><li>Enemy Chaser shoots rockets that track down enemies</li><li>Iron Lizard shoots a bomb that travels on ground and explodes when it hits an enemy</li><li>Drop Shot shoots iron balls that bounce on the ground until it hits an enemy</li><li>Super Grenade fires a rocket that travels forward and causes a large explosion.</li></ul><h2>Critical Reception</h2><p>Game Informer gave the review scores of 6 and 6 out of ten. Jay Fitzlof wrote, \"Metal Slug X has plenty of action, with enemies jumping at you from all sides, plenty of weapons and vehicles to try out, and lots of hidden items to discover. The only problem is, assumming you use the unlimited continues, you''ll finish the game in about half and hour... it feels like Metal Slug X would work better on a handheld. In fact I know it would since I thoroughly enjoyed the two Metal Slugs on the Neo Geo Pocket Color only a year ago\".</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Overview </h2>In The X-Files Game the player assumes the role of an <a data-ref-id=\"3015-5418\" href=\"/federal-bureau-of-investigation/3015-5418/\">       FBI</a> agent named Craig Willmore who is tasked with solving the disappearance of FBI special agents <a data-ref-id=\"3005-2658\" href=\"/fox-mulder/3005-2658/\">             Fox Mulder</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-2659\" href=\"/dana-scully/3005-2659/\">            Dana Scully</a>. Throughout the game the player is assisted by their FBI partner and other characters from the show, including Mulder and Scully's boss A.D. <a data-ref-id=\"3005-15361\" href=\"/walter-skinner/3005-15361/\">           Walter Skinner</a>.  These characters feature sporadically, along with others such as the <a data-ref-id=\"3005-15375\" href=\"/the-smoking-man/3005-15375/\">          Smoking Man</a> and the Lone Gunmen.<br /> <br /><h2>Gameplay</h2>The game is a <a data-ref-id=\"3015-75\" href=\"/point-and-click/3015-75/\">        point-and-click</a> adventure, and features a cursor that adapts to the environment. This means that it changes depending on what is highlighted - to an eye, or a hand, or a mouth for initiating a conversation. Players also have an inventory of stock items, such as their FBI badge and a handgun, as well as items collected in the game world. <br /><br />The game relies heavily on <a data-ref-id=\"3015-604\" href=\"/full-motion-video/3015-604/\">         FMV</a> (full motion video) featuring live actors, including several of the show's stars such as <a data-ref-id=\"3040-1433\" href=\"/david-duchovny/3040-1433/\">      David Duchovny</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3040-1432\" href=\"/gillian-anderson/3040-1432/\">     Gillian Anderson</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3040-1436\" href=\"/mitch-pileggi/3040-1436/\">    Mitch Pileggi</a>. Conversations, while featuring <a data-ref-id=\"3015-77\" href=\"/dialogue-trees/3015-77/\">   dialogue trees</a>, are pre-recorded videos.   <br /> <br />There are also shooting moments that generally play in a manner similar to FMV <a data-ref-id=\"3015-169\" href=\"/on-rails/3015-169/\">  light-gun shooters</a>, such as Mad Dog McGraw. These are also alongside moments where the player must make a snap decision, similar to modern <a data-ref-id=\"3015-6\" href=\"/quick-time-event/3015-6/\"> quick-time events</a>. The environments are generally static, and rather than have the player fluidly move through them, they are made up of slides of images.  <br /> <br />The game features various moments of 'fan service', referencing events, characters and elements of the mythology. This includes the famous 'black oil' as well as the radiation from alien encounters, and the famous 'stiletto' weapon. There are also other nods to fans, such as Willmore asking Skinner about Mulder and Scully's romantic relationship.<br /> <br />The game was originally released for the PC and Mac in 1998, and later ported to Sony's Playstation for release in 1999. The PC release took up 7 discs, whilst the Playstation release was spaced over 4.",

Because of the relatively large storage capacity of the laserdisc, Cinematronics were able to create a game that featured higher fidelity graphics than other contemporary games. It was also a highly influential title of its time, opening the floodgates to several other laserdisc titles, such as <a href=\"/space-ace/3030-463/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-463\">Space Ace</a>, <a href=\"/begas-battle/3030-36549/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-36549\">Bega's Battle</a>, and <a href=\"/cliff-hanger/3030-18849/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18849\">Cliff Hanger</a>.</p><h2>Story</h2><p>Dragon's Lair puts players in the greaves of Dirk the Daring, a knight trying to rescue the Princess Daphne. Daphne has been kidnapped by Singe the Dragon, and is now being held in the castle. Dirk's adventure will have him battling monsters and the castle alike as he attempts to save the day.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6763/462473-s_dragonslair_5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-462473\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.6765625\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:67.7%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6763/462473-s_dragonslair_5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-462473\"><img alt=\"Dragon's Lair played like an animated Choose Your Own Adventure book.\" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6763/462473-s_dragonslair_5.jpg\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/6763/462473-s_dragonslair_5.jpg 640w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/6763/462473-s_dragonslair_5.jpg 480w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6763/462473-s_dragonslair_5.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Dragon's Lair played like an animated Choose Your Own Adventure book.</figcaption></figure><p>The gameplay of Dragon's Lair varies wildly from version to version, a common misconception is that the \"<a href=\"/quick-time-event/3015-6/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6\">Quick Time Event</a>\" game is the only version of Dragon's Lair in existence, however on platforms like the NES and SNES, Dragon's Lair is a 2D platformer requiring players to navigate multi-tiered stages, finding one of multiple exits to complete a level and progress through the castle to the final boss fight. The QTE-focused game only appears on certain platforms, in this variation of the game players watch and sometimes control Dirk through his adventures though Singe's castle. At very specific intervals during the game, Dirk will be in a situation that will force the player to control him, choosing which to direction to move him in around or having him attack enemies. Each of these sequences would trigger a new scene in the movie to start playing, similar to the way a DVD can have different \"chapters\" to select at any time. Choosing the right action in these confrontations would cause Dirk to circumnavigate his obstacle with aplomb, while choosing the wrong action would trigger a sequence in which Dirk is killed. The player is helped out by some degree of input clues such as flashing lights letting them know the direction to push. Added help to these sequences was added in the iPhone version which by default causes the on screen controls to flash the correct input, although this feature can be turned of if desired. The limited, simple button pressing gameplay set to cinematic action that would later evolve into the <a href=\"/quick-time-event/3015-6/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6\">Quick Time Event</a>, featured in games like <a href=\"/shenmue/3030-7812/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7812\">Shenmue</a>, <a href=\"/resident-evil-4/3030-1578/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1578\">Resident Evil 4</a>, and <a href=\"/heavy-rain/3030-21304/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21304\">Heavy Rain</a>.</p><p>In the original arcade version, the castle's rooms were presented in a semi-randomized order. The player would advance to a new room regardless of whether they could complete the previous one, however before the final confrontation with the dragon, the player would be required to replay the scenes they failed. In addition many of the rooms played \"in reverse\" (meaning, a jump to the left became a jump to the right the second time a scene played) meaning that even if one were to memorize every room in the castle they would still have to keep a keen eye on the layout of each room. The high score table was usually part of a separate cabinet extension.</p><p>An experienced player who memorized every input for every scene could complete the game in less than 10 minutes. These experienced players soon realized that the player's score was increased with every successful input, regardless if the scene ended in success or failure. Thus, the score could be inflated by purposely dying before the last move of a long scene, and saving the last \"life\" for the final scene with the dragon. As new lives were rewarded throughout the game, these players could extend their play time to 20 minutes or more on one credit.</p><h2>Development</h2><p>Dragon’s Lair was the brain child of <a href=\"/rick-dyer/3040-47901/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-47901\">Rick Dyer</a>, president of Advanced Microcomputer Systems, who, supposedly, realized that video games needed top quality animation during a viewing of the animated film The Secret of NIMH. He also claims that the Atari 2600 classic “Adventure” was another inspiration for Dragon’s Lair. The entire game was animated by Disney Animator Don Bluth at his personal studio. The game was made in less than 7 months for a mere one million dollars (cheap considering the work they were doing with new technology). The animators on the game couldn’t afford to hire real models to provide an appropriate frame for the Princess Daphne, so Cinematronic’s team apparently used Playboy magazines as an inspiration.</p><h2>Xbox Live Arcade Port</h2><p>On March 19th, 2012 it was announced that Dragon's Lair was coming to <a href=\"/xbox-live-marketplace/3045-86/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-86\">Xbox Live Arcade</a>. The port is developed by <a href=\"/digital-leisure-inc/3010-50/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-50\">Digital Leisure</a> and published by <a href=\"/microsoft-studios/3010-340/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-340\">Microsoft Studios</a>.

    "description": "<p><br/>In the game the player takes on the role of a teenager who is about to step out into the world and has to avoid the many temptations of life, the main one being drugs. The gameplay is similar to that of side scrollers or Space Invaders, the player controls the teen who has to shift from side to side to avoid the drug pushers attacks of needles and other drugs. The player can fight off the drug pushers by attacking them with the word 'NO'. The player has a resistance bar (the players health) which goes down every time the player gets hit by oncoming drugs. If your bar reaches the bottom you die of a drug overdose.</p> <p> </p> <p>The game was published as part of a \"Say NO to Drugs\" Campaign.

Following the plot of the movie (also including modified scenes from the movie in key cutscenes), Batman investigates an illegal drug shipment of crime boss Carmine Falcone, only to find intricate plots by <a href=\"/scarecrow/3005-4907/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4907\">Dr. Jonathan Crane</a> (a fear-manipulating psychiatrist at <a href=\"/arkham-asylum/3035-1236/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1236\">Arkham Asylum</a>).</p><p>One of the key elements of Batman Begins that separate it from the other Batman games is the concept of fear as a weapon. By performing certain actions, such as performing special interactions with the environment or taking out enemies in the vicinity, nearby enemies can become afraid. Scared enemies can have a variety of negative effects, such as sloppy fighting techniques, bad weapon aim, and (when very afraid) total disarmament. Batman can also <a href=\"/interrogation/3015-5919/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5919\">interrogate</a> most enemies, instilling fear while obtaining certain information or keys.</p><h2><b>Gameplay</b></h2><h3>Combat: Fear &amp; Interrogation</h3><p>Fear is your weapon in Batman Begins as you are able to interact with a lot of your environment to take out enemies one at a time causing the remaining criminals to cringe in fear. This fear aids you in combat as the opponents that are scared of you are much easier targets. Moreover, fear allows opponents to give up information quicker. This is done through small sequences where Batman picks up an enemy who is trying to get away and interrogates him by punching him and asking him questions. Two of the face-buttons correspond to punching and kicking and another is for performing multiple enemy attacks and finishing moves. However the game does not have a very extensive amount of moves which Batman is known for and the animations are very repetitive.</p><h3><b>The Batmobile</b></h3><p>The Batmobile sequences in this game are few and far between and resemble the Burnout games. The Batmobile can race through the streets of Gotham and ram vehicles off the side of the</p><h2>Plot</h2><p>Following the plot of the movie, Batman Begins tells the tale of Bruce Wayne's ascent from rich playboy to feared superhero.</p><p>When Bruce Wayne was just a child, he watched a mugger savagely gun his parents down out of desperation. As he grew, Wayne couldn't handle the pain inside of him and chose to travel the world learning about criminals, and the methods that can be used to disarm them. Having accumulated basic training, Wayne found himself in prison after trying to steal some of the merchandise from his own company, Wayne Enterprises in Eastern Asia. When he is sent to a two-bit prison he is confronted by a man called Henry Ducard who proposes Bruce join the League of Shadows, a force presenting justice to unjust places throughout the world. soon after, Bruce is released from prison and makes his way to the League of Shadows, based on top of a mountain. Impressing the League's leader, Ra's Al Ghul, Bruce trains with the League and develops his skill.</p><p>Eventually Henry presents Bruce with his final challenge, to kill a farmer who murdered another man. Bruce refuses and gets into a battle which kills Ra's and blows up the League. Bruce saves Ducard however, based on a mentor-student relationship that they have developed.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9726/266431-batbmultiscrnbatman.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-266431\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.74945054945055\" data-width=\"455\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 455px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.9%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9726/266431-batbmultiscrnbatman.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-266431\"><img alt=\"Batman\" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/9726/266431-batbmultiscrnbatman.jpg\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/9726/266431-batbmultiscrnbatman.jpg 455w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/9726/266431-batbmultiscrnbatman.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Batman</figcaption></figure><p>Returning to Gotham, Bruce begins to craft Batman, a vigilante persona he can adopt in order to wage war on the criminal syndicates throughout the city whilst protecting the people he cares about.</p><p>As Batman begins eliminating crime throughout the city, he learns of a grander scheme, one that involves a mysterious psychologist named Jonathan Crane, who poses as the Scarecrow, dumping a weaponised hallucinogen into the water mains.

Ra's explains that the League of Shadows serves as an executioner of civilizations, killing them off when they become too infested.

Undoubtedly, however, this was the FIFA to play the fastest, control the easiest and feature the heaviest use of the skill stick, while it's successor slowed the game down by reportedly 40% and put a heavier emphasis on passing. This was also the first, and last FIFA to make managerial mode tiered, requiring the player to manage lowly clubs, building a reputation, and slowly moving up to the cream of the crop, so to speak. <br/> <br/><h3>Game Modes   </h3>Manager Mode- Manager Mode allows you to take on the role of manager and lead your club to victory in the league.

    "deck": "Cyan's first venture to bring both online gameplay to the Myst universe and to create a 3rd person adventure game based on the Myst franchise.",
    "description": "<p><i>Uru: Ages Beyond Myst</i> is a 3rd person adventure game developed by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-83\" href=\"/cyan-worlds-inc/3010-83/\" slug=\"cyan-worlds-inc\">Cyan Worlds</a> and published by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-82\" href=\"/ubisoft-entertainment/3010-82/\" slug=\"ubisoft-entertainment\">Ubisoft</a>. <i>Uru</i> marks Cyan Worlds' second game to use the real-time 3D <a data-ref-id=\"3015-7737\" href=\"/plasma/3015-7737/\" slug=\"plasma\">Plasma</a> engine (the first game was <i>RealMyst</i>) and the first game to introduce a multiplayer component, called <i><a data-ref-id=\"3030-1572\" href=\"/myst-online-uru-live/3030-1572/\" slug=\"myst-online-uru-live\">Uru Live</a></i>. <i>Uru</i> is a departure from the previous games in the franchise, taking place in the modern era and allowing players to customize their onscreen avatars. Cyan began developing <i>Uru</i> shortly after completing <i><a data-ref-id=\"3035-1123\" href=\"/riven/3035-1123/\" slug=\"riven\">Riven</a></i> in 1997, leaving future Myst sequels to be produced by third party developers. <i>Uru</i> required five years and $12 million to complete. Uri was initially conceived as a multiplayer game; the single-player portion was released, but the multiplayer component, <i>Uru Live</i>, was delayed and cancelled, leaving it to be briefly picked up by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-1268\" href=\"/gametap/3010-1268/\" slug=\"gametap\">GameTap</a> in February, 2007, before it was cancelled again. The future of <i>Uru Live</i> is uncertain.</p><p>After <i>Uru Live</i> was first cancelled, addition ages were released through expansion packs titles <i><a data-ref-id=\"3030-2179\" href=\"/uru-to-dni/3030-2179/\" slug=\"uru-to-dni\">Uru: To D'ni</a></i> and <i><a data-ref-id=\"3030-18683\" href=\"/uru-the-path-of-the-shell/3030-18683/\" slug=\"uru-the-path-of-the-shell\">Uru: The Path of the Shell</a></i>. <i>Uru: Ages Beyond Myst</i> and both of these expansions were later released in a collection called <i>Uru Complete Chronicles</i>.</p><p><i>Uru</i> was not as well received as previous Myst titles. Critics admired the visuals and new features of the game but criticized the lack of multiplayer in the retail version and clunky controls. <i>Uru</i> sold poorly, while the first three games had sold millions of copies each. The game was a critical and commercial disappointment for Cyan, causing the company financial troubles; nevertheless, it has attracted a cult following.</p><h2>Plot</h2><p>Unlike previous games in the series, <i>Uru's</i> story mixes fictional plot elements with real-world events. According to the game's fictional history, archeologists found an entrance to a vast underground cavern in the 1980s near a volcano in New Mexico. The caves led to an ancient abandoned city built by the enigmatic D'ni civilization. The D'ni practiced an ancient ability known as the Art. By writing a description of another world, the D'ni created \"linking books\" which served as portals to the worlds described, known as Ages. Soon after making contact with a single human, the entire civilization suddenly disappeared two hundred years ago. In <i>Uru's</i> story, the video game <i><a data-ref-id=\"3030-3970\" href=\"/myst/3030-3970/\" slug=\"myst\">Myst</a></i> was created when the archeological leaders approached a development studio Cyan asked them to create a game to educate the public about the D'ni. <i>Myst</i> sold millions of copies, and Cyan continued to produce games based on D'ni findings. In the present day, a group known as the D'ni Restoration Council or DRC reopens the passages to the D'ni caverns and begins to rebuild the abandoned cities</p><p>Players begin <i>Uru's</i> story in New Mexico near the Cleft, a deep fissure in the ground that leads to the D'ni caverns. A man who introduces himself as Zandi sits in front of his trailer by the Cleft, encouraging the player to discover the environment and join the exploration. The player stumbles across a hologram of a woman, Yeesha, who tells him or her the story of the D'ni and requests for help to rebuild the civilization. The player must solve puzzles in and around the Cleft to find seven journey cloths, which enable a path to the Age of Relto. The plot is unresolved at the end of the single-player game; later expansions and online content continue the game's story.</p><h2>Soundtrack</h2><p>Cyan Worlds self-published the soundtrack, titled <i>Uru Music</i>, by <a data-ref-id=\"3040-18349\" href=\"/tim-larkin/3040-18349/\" slug=\"tim-larkin\">Tim Larkin</a> on December 18, 2003.</p><table class=\"t-editor full-width with-out-border with-border\"><tbody><tr><th>No.</th><th>Track Title</th><th>Length (52:10)</th></tr><tr><td>1.</td><td><b>Atrus Open</b></td><td>1:07</td></tr><tr><td>2.</td><td><b>Beyond Gira</b></td><td>5:51</td></tr><tr><td>3.</td><td><b>Out of the Hive</b></td><td>3:05</td></tr><tr><td>4.</td><td><b>Badlands</b></td><td>2:31</td></tr><tr><td>5.</td><td><b>Gallery Theme</b></td><td>2:54</td></tr><tr><td>6.</td><td><b>Air Stream</b></td><td>4:11</td></tr><tr><td>7.</td><td><b>Yeesha's Theme</b></td><td>3:48</td></tr><tr><td>8.</td><td><b>Convergence</b></td><td>2:58</td></tr><tr><td>9.</td><td><b>The Well</b></td><td>3:27</td></tr><tr><td>10.</td><td><b>Spore Me</b></td><td>2:41</td></tr><tr><td>11.</td><td><b>Baron's Theme</b></td><td>2:16</td></tr><tr><td>12.</td><td><b>The Library</b></td><td>1:35</td></tr><tr><td>13.</td><td><b>The Vault</b></td><td>6:15</td></tr><tr><td>14.</td><td><b>Trailer Music</b></td><td>2:26</td></tr><tr><td>15.</td><td><b>Fall of D'ni</b></td><td>3:06</td></tr><tr><td>16.</td><td><b>The Bahro</b></td><td>1:52</td></tr><tr><td>17.</td><td><b>Dirt</b></td><td>2:07</td></tr></tbody></table>",

    "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Maximum Velocity was developed Nd Cube as a launch title for the Game Boy Advance. Maximum Velocity and the original F-Zero have much in common, because each were launch titles for their respective systems as a show piece for the systems capabilities. Maximum Velocity has a very similar graphical style as the original F-Zero using the Mode 7 to simulate 3D graphics. Maximum Velocity is the only F-Zero title to not feature Captain Falcon or other racers from the original F-Zero.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/696351-f_zero___maximum_velocity06.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-696351\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.66666666666667\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.7%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/696351-f_zero___maximum_velocity06.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-696351\"><img alt=\"The game's art style is very similar to the original F-Zero\" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/7465/696351-f_zero___maximum_velocity06.png\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/7465/696351-f_zero___maximum_velocity06.png 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px\" data-width=\"240\"></a><figcaption>The game's art style is very similar to the original F-Zero</figcaption></figure><p>The gameplay in Maximum Velocity is extremely similar to all the previous F-Zero games, but is most similar to the original F-Zero. In Maximum Velocity there are a series of Grand Prixs each with five tracks to race. The game involves piloting futuristic racing crafts through tracks with the main objective being to come in first by the end of the race. As each lap is completed the player must be in at a high enough ranking in the race otherwise they are eliminated. With each set of grand prixs the tracks will gradually get harder. There's also a choice of difficulty to choose from for each grand prix, and this will change the skill of the computer opponents in a race. There are four different grand prixs in the game- Pawn Series, Knight Series, Bishop Series and Queen Series.</p><p>There was also a multiplayer component to Maximum Velocity. It is up to four other players with a Game Boy link cable, and there the option of using either a multi card option or single card option. There are more features when using a multi card play, and can play an entire series of tracks against other players. Whereas with the single card play it was limited to only one track to race on.</p><h3>Vehicles</h3><p>There are four vehicles to choose from at the very start of Maximum Velocity, and there are six unlockable vehicles. The four available vehicles are:</p><ul><li>Hot Violet</li><li>Fireball</li><li>J.B. Crystal</li><li>Wind Walker</li></ul><p>The six other vehicles that are unlockable upong winning challenges are</p><ul><li>Sly Joker</li><li>Sting Ray</li><li>Silver Thunder</li><li>Falcon MK-II</li><li>Fighting Comet</li><li>Jet Vermilion</li></ul><p>Each car has its own specific statistics usually involved with speed, handling and boost power. The statistics affect each race greatly, and the player would have to find and option they are most comfortable with.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Summary</h2><p>Baldur's Gate is a fantasy <a href=\"/games/?sort=release_date&amp;filter_type=genre&amp;filter_value=5/\">role-playing game</a> developed by <a href=\"/bioware/3010-98/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-98\">Bioware</a> and released in 1998 for the <a href=\"/pc/3045-94/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">PC</a>. It is the first role-playing game developed by Bioware and it ushered forth a new age of PC role-playing games set within the numerous <a href=\"/dungeons-dragons/3025-167/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-167\">Dungeons and Dragons</a> universes. It was first game to use Bioware's <a href=\"/infinity-engine/3015-495/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-495\">Infinity Engine</a> which was used for several RPGs to follow. In Baldur's Gate, the player creates their own <a href=\"/customizable-characters/3015-155/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-155\">customizable hero</a>, selecting their sex, character portrait, race, <a href=\"/classes/3015-405/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-405\">class</a>, abilities, <a href=\"/alignment/3015-146/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-146\">alignment</a>, and voice. In the role of this character, the player will set off on an epic adventure along the Sword Coast.</p><p>The player will battle powerful characters and savage monsters, investigate the iron crisis, and gain numerous allies on the way to finding their <a href=\"/mentor/3015-1386/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1386\">mentor's</a> <a href=\"/murder/3015-1654/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1654\">murderer</a>. The game's story is told through in-game scripted <a href=\"/cutscene/3015-22/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-22\">cutscenes</a>, <a href=\"/text-based/3015-2199/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2199\">text-based dialogue</a> with hand drawn portraits of significant characters, pre-rendered movies at significant places, and voiced intros for each chapter.</p><p>Baldur's Gate received a retail-released <a href=\"/expansion/3015-344/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-344\">expansion pack</a> in 1999 called <a href=\"/baldurs-gate-tales-of-the-sword-coast/3030-7392/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7392\">Baldur's Gate: Tales of the Sword Coast</a>.</p><p>An enhanced version of Baldur's Gate is now available for tablets and modern PC's.</p><h2>Story</h2><p>The game opens with a quote:</p><blockquote><p>\"He who fights with monsters should look to it that he himself does not become a monster... when you gaze long into the abyss, the abyss also gazes into you...\"</p></blockquote><p>-Friedrich Nietzsche</p><h3>Intro</h3><p>As the pre-rendered cutscene plays, a fully armored <a href=\"/knight/3015-1291/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1291\">knight</a> stumbles out onto the roof of a building. The door to the roof shuts behind him as he falls to his knees in exhaustion. He hears his pursuer coming, and as he turns his head to see him his pursuer breaks through the door. It is a large figure, clad in dark spiked armor and bellowing a deeply <a href=\"/evil-laugh/3015-1842/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1842\">sinister laugh</a>. He stands in the doorway a moment, signifying his presence. The scared knight scoots away on his back, whimpering, \"No, you can't!\" The armored figure states, \"I will be the last, and you will go first,\" as if to explain his following actions. He laughs and continues walking towards the knight, who has now backed himself against the iron fence bordering the roof. \"There are others. I can show you! Please! Please!\" the knight cries. He turns and tries to grab the iron fence. He looks back at the armored figure just as he punches him to the floor, knocking his helmet off. The figure laughs as he grabs the man by his throat, pulling him to his feet and pushing him through the iron fence. He now has the man dangling over the city below, kicking frantically and choking. \"Please\" the man is able to say once more. The camera pans towards the glowing yellow eyes of the armored figure as a loud snapping sound is heard. The figure continues his demonic laugh and then hurls the man off the building. He falls lifelessly down to the cobblestone streets below. Blood drips from his body, making its own path through the bumpy cobblestones. A single trail of blood flows into the top of an out-of-place \"S,\" and as the streets fade to black, the camera zooms out and reveals the game's title, \"Baldur's Gate.\"</p><p>You start the game in the <a href=\"/mansion/3035-1870/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1870\">manor</a> of <a href=\"/candlekeep/3035-122/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-122\">Candlekeep</a>, a secluded academy dedicated to the preservation of literature and knowledge. You learn that you were raised in the Keep after being found as an <a href=\"/orphan/3015-2205/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2205\">orphaned</a> child out in the world. Your adoptive father is a powerful <a href=\"/wizards/3015-1694/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1694\">mage</a> named <a href=\"/gorion/3005-15905/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-15905\">Gorion</a>, and you have just received word that you and he have to leave the <a href=\"/citadel/3035-2540/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2540\">citadel</a>. You are told to see Gorion as soon as possible, as there is something very urgent he needs to tell you. There are various tasks to be done and supplies to gather in the city, but once you feel you are ready you set out with Gorion. He instructs you that if trouble should befall him on your journey, you are to head to the Friendly Arm Inn, where he has friends. As night falls on the first day out of the Keep, you and your mentor are suddenly ambushed by the man from the earlier cinematic as well as two <a href=\"/ogres/3015-1426/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1426\">Ogres</a> and a woman. Gorion tells you to flee for your safety and prepares to fight the band of villains. Gorion is able to kill the Ogres and woman, but in the end he is slain by the Armored Figure.</p><p>Following the death of your foster father, you will (if you follow the suggested game outline) head to the Friendly Arm Inn to meet with Gorion's old Harper friends, the strong-willed <a href=\"/jaheira/3005-4204/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4204\">Jaheira</a> and her timid husband <a href=\"/khalid/3005-11087/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-11087\">Khalid</a>. On the way to the inn, an old man stops you. While it ostensibly has something to do with the plot, it is merely fan service because it is <a href=\"/elminster/3005-644/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-644\">Elminster</a>. After you join up with your father's friends, they tell you how they were planning on heading south, to Nashkel, to deal with an iron crisis that has gripped the entire Sword Coast. You agree to help them, and your new party heads off south to find adventure. The game is, however, designed with a great amount of flexibility, and even though dealing with the situation in Nashkel is required to unlock later chapters of the game, you are free to pick your own path in getting there. One options is for instance to travel with <a href=\"/xzar/3005-11556/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-11556\">Xzar</a> and <a href=\"/montaron/3005-11557/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-11557\">Montaron</a>, who meet you on the road out of <a href=\"/candlekeep/3035-122/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-122\">Candlekeep</a> and are also headed to Nashkel to investigate the iron problem. The only path that is closed to you is to return to Candlekeep; nobody is allowed inside without offering an expensive book as their entrance fee.</p><p>Soon, you are caught up in a major crisis that on the surface appears to be an economic plot, led by the Iron Throne, to destroy all iron reserves on the Sword Coast and force the local governments into capitulating to their demands. However, it turns out that it is all part of a plot by <a href=\"/sarevok/3005-1125/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1125\">Sarevok</a>, your father's murderer and your estranged half-brother, to kill as many children of Bhaal as he can in order to gain power. It turns out you and Sarevok are both the mortal progeny of the former God of Murder - and no one will be able to take his mantle until all the other children of Bhaal are dead. As more children of Bhaal are slain at the hands of another, powers and abilities are <a href=\"/unlockables/3015-1414/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1414\">unlocked</a> within themselves due to the dark nature of their blood. Sarevok was targeting you - and it ends up being your quest to put an end to his reign of terror, and temporarily free the Sword Coast from the grips of evil.</p><h2>Setting</h2><p>Baldur's Gate is set in the <a href=\"/the-forgotten-realms/3035-29/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-29\">Forgotten Realms</a> <a href=\"/campaign/3015-4011/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4011\">campaign</a> setting.

Although it would be difficult to incorporate every aspect of a pen and paper RPG, Baldur's Gate offers a faithful translation of the source material into video-game form. The game can be played in <a href=\"/real-time-game-clock/3015-2519/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2519\">real-time</a>, much like an action game, can be manually paused at any time to give orders, or can be set to automatically pause when various conditions are met (someone is injured, someone runs out of ammo, after every round, etc.) Having the game pause after every round of combat closely mirrors the gameplay of the tabletop versions of <a href=\"/dungeons-dragons/3025-167/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-167\">D&amp;D</a>, and makes Baldur's Gate feel very much like a <a href=\"/turn-based/3015-192/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-192\">turn based</a> strategy game. Some concepts in Baldur's Gate, such as spell-casting, questing, stat-based gameplay, inventory management, and even non-combat solutions to problems have direct correlation to core gameplay elements in Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons.</p><p>Also from AD&amp;D come the races and classes available for player characters. Characters can be either male or female versions of a <a href=\"/dwarves/3015-940/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-940\">Dwarf</a>, <a href=\"/elf/3015-537/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-537\">Elf</a>, <a href=\"/gnomes/3015-1447/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1447\">Gnome</a>, <a href=\"/half-elves/3015-3913/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3913\">Half-Elf</a>, <a href=\"/halfling/3015-2643/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2643\">Halfling</a> or a <a href=\"/human/3015-810/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-810\">Human</a>. Each of the races offers different bonuses or <a href=\"/two-difficulty-levels-at-once/3015-4331/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4331\">handicaps</a> in different areas of gameplay. Once a race is selected, the player can then pick from one of eight classes: <a href=\"/clerics/3015-4055/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4055\">Cleric</a>, <a href=\"/druids/3015-4091/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4091\">Druid</a>, <a href=\"/bandit/3015-3588/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3588\">Thief</a>, <a href=\"/bards/3015-1915/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1915\">Bard</a>, <a href=\"/fighter/3015-2648/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2648\">Fighter</a>, <a href=\"/rangers/3015-2854/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2854\">Ranger</a>, <a href=\"/paladins/3015-3467/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3467\">Paladin</a> or <a href=\"/wizards/3015-1694/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1694\">Mage</a>. Furthermore, Mages can specialize in one of the schools of <a href=\"/magic/3015-98/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-98\">magic</a>, gaining bonus spells from the school while losing access to spells from an opposing school. Each class has unique abilities and this choice largely dictates how your character would approach combat situations. There is also an option to Multiclass or Dual Class. Human characters who have reached at least level two in their first class can choose to Dual Class, and start leveling in a different class. Once their new class outlevels their original class, they regain all the skills and abilities they had gained in their first class. Non-human characters can be created as Multiclass characters, where you can gain the abilities and features of two or three class at the expense of a slower progression in each class; a \"jack of all trades, master of none\" approach. Human characters can't Multiclass and non-human characters can't Dual Class, and both Multiclassing and Dual Classing are limited to certain combinations of Fighter, Mage, Cleric, Thief, Ranger and Druid.</p><p>There are also attributes that represent how effective characters are in the game. Strength, Intelligence, Wisdom, Dexterity, Constitution and Charisma all influence how well characters attack, defend, and interact with others. These <a href=\"/attributes/3015-1681/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1681\">attributes</a> are rolled by the engine as 3D6, with some modifiers for the Non-human races. Important attributes for each class will have an elevated minimum value. A Human character's attributes will also determine whether or not the character can be Dual Classed; the character must have at least 15 in the prime attributes of the first class, and at least 17 in those of the second class, in order to be eligible for Dual Classing, and the character's alignment must also be compatible with the desired new class. For instance, a Fighter would need Str 15 and Wis 17 in order to Dual Class to Cleric, but there would be no alignment incompatibilities. A fighter who wanted to Dual Class to Druid would need Str 15, Wis 17 and Cha 17, and would also need to be of True Neutral alignment.</p><h2>The Infinity Engine</h2><p>The <a href=\"/infinity-engine/3015-495/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-495\">Infinity Engine</a> was developed by <a href=\"/wikid/bioware/65-98/\" data-ref-id=\"bioware\">BioWare</a> for a project called Battleground Infinity, which ultimately became Baldur's Gate. <a href=\"/wikid/bioware/65-98/\" data-ref-id=\"bioware\">BioWare</a> used it again in several installments of the Baldur's Gate Series, and also licensed the Engine to <a href=\"/wikid/interplay-entertainment-corp/65-580/\" data-ref-id=\"interplay-entertainment-corp\">Interplay's</a> <a href=\"/black-isle-studios/3010-99/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-99\">Black Isle Studios</a>. The Infinity Engine allows real-time gameplay. The AD&amp;D RPG stats are 'rolled', and the player can either pause the game or let the events happen without stopping the action. The engine uses an isometric perspective with pre-rendered <a href=\"/2d/3015-1427/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1427\">2D</a> backgrounds and sprite-based characters. It was one of the very first games to use the LUA-Scripting Language, allowing to script events and customize the behavior of <a href=\"/non-player-character/3015-967/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-967\">NPC's</a>. The game also allows the players to import custom sound files and pictures for the playable characters in the game. The mod-scene embraced the Infinity Engine, and there are many mods and files available for the game - even a custom character sound set featuring the voices of <a href=\"/ray-muzyka/3040-12762/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-12762\">Dr. Ray Muzyka</a> (CEO, Producer of the game) and <a href=\"/james-ohlen/3040-12756/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-12756\">James Ohlen</a> (Lead Designer) of <a href=\"/wikid/bioware/65-98/\" data-ref-id=\"bioware\">BioWare</a>.</p><h2>Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition</h2><p>An updated and remastered version of Baldur's Gate developed by Beamdog (consisting of former Bioware employees and Infinity Engine modders) was released on PC November 28th, 2012 with an iOS version following shortly thereafter. Features of the Enhanced Edition include:</p><ul><li>many of the tweaks and enhancements added in Baldur's Gate II</li><li>built-in functionality for some of the most popular community made mods</li><li>rebuilt engine that improves framerate and responsiveness regardless of underlying hardware</li><li>support for modern resolutions and camera zoom levels</li><li>improved pathfinding AI</li><li>hundreds of new bugfixes</li><li>3 new companions with personal side quests of their own, and another secret companion</li><li>new playable class kits, such as Dwarven Defender and Blackguard</li><li>The Black Pits, a standalone mini-campaign focused on combat arena battles</li></ul><h3>The Siege of Dragonspear</h3><p>An all-new expansion campaign was added as paid DLC on March 31, 2016. <a href=\"/baldurs-gate-siege-of-dragonspear/3030-50974/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-50974\">Siege of Dragonspear</a> bridges the story from the end of Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition to the beginning of Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition. It includes new areas, items, enemies, and companions. Some classic characters, such as Minsc and Irenicus, return with newly recorded voice acting by their original voice actors who have reprised their roles.</p><p> </p><h2>Soundtrack</h2><figure

Players are rewarded with Assault Points which can      be used to obtain items specific to each zone. One specific Assault area, known      as Nyzul Isle, has player ascending 100 floors and completing a randomly      set task on each floor. You can obtain many very good armor pieces after      defeating the bosses at every twenty floor interval, and you also could      receive a weapon upon completion of the 100th floor, which is the base      plate of a newer \"relic\" type weapon.</li><li><b> Besieged</b>  - The lower ward of Aht      Urhgan known as Al Zahbi is under attack by the beastmen armies, looking      to capture the mysterious Astral Candescence. Players battle in the area against      the enemy along with many NPCs, which, if not fallen/captured in the      course of battle, provide players with many helpful items. Defeat of the      five Serpent General, will allow for the door sealing the Astral      Candescence to open and allow of the beastmen to take it. If this occurs,      players much head out into the dangerous enemy strongholds, and get it      back.</li><li><b> Salvage</b>  - Taking place in one of      the five wings of the Alzadaal Undersea Ruins, Salvage is a true test of      teamwork for a group of 6 to 18 players. As soon as the group enters, the      Pathos of Alzadaal limits the abilities of all players who enter,      including the ability to equip armor. Players must find key items to      unlock their abilities again, and make their way up the five floors to      defeat the boss at the end. Some monsters within the zones drop level 15,      25, and 35 armor pieces which are required to complete a quest to obtain      level 75 armor pieces, some of which are the considered the best pieces      available thus far for certain jobs.</li><li><b> Einherjar</b>  - The Hazhalm Testing      Grounds are the site of this large scale battlefield area. Designed for      groups of up to 36 people level 60 and up, Einherjar is a race against the      clock to defeat enemy swarms, and a final boss monster. There are four      wings, and three chambers within the first three  wings for players      to navigate. You must complete each chamber in a wing to advance to the      next wing. Rewards are given for the amount of monsters cleared in the      form of \"Therion Ichor\", which are accumulated to obtain items,      and also items are given for completion of the chamber. Ascent to the      final chamber will have you fight a very well known character in the Final      Fantasy series, Odin. Defeat of him rewards you handsomely with Abjuration      items which can be upgraded into superior armor pieces.</li></ul> <br/> <p><b> <h2>Soundtrack</h2></b></p> <p> </p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1665/1202139-ahturhgan.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1202139\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.98684210526316\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:98.7%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1665/1202139-ahturhgan.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1202139\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/1665/1202139-ahturhgan.gif\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/1665/1202139-ahturhgan.gif 152w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 152px) 100vw, 152px\" data-width=\"152\"></a></figure> <p>The Treasures of Aht Urhgan soundtrack was released on May 29, 2006, and was re-released as part of the FINAL FANTASY XI Premium Box on March 27, 2008  <br/> <br/>01 - Bustle of the Capital<br/> 02 - Eastward Bound...<br/> 03 - Bandits' Market<br/> 04 - Illusions in the Mist<br/> 05 - Mercenaries' Delight<br/> 06 - Jeweled Boughs<br/> 07 - Ululations from Beyond<br/> 08 - Rapid Onslaught -Assault-<br/> 09 - Fated Strife -Besieged-<br/> 10 - Delve<br/> 11 - Whispers of the Gods<br/> 12 - Circuit de Chocobo<br/>13 - Run Chocobo, Run! <br/>14 - The Colosseum<br/> 15 - Black Coffin<br/> 16 - A Puppet's Slumber<br/> 17 - Ever-Turning Wheels<br/> 18 - Forbidden Seal<br/> 19 - Hellriders<br/> 20 - Eternal Gravestone<br/>  21 - Vana'diel March #4 </p>",

    "description": "<h2>Overview</h2>This game is based entirely on the first Star Wars movie, Episode IV: A New Hope. The opening of the game features an animated cinematic of the opening scene of the film. After that the player takes control of <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1062\" href=\"/luke-skywalker/3005-1062/\" slug=\"luke-skywalker\"> Luke Skywalker</a>, driving the  landspeeder across <a data-ref-id=\"3035-319\" href=\"/tatooine/3035-319/\" slug=\"tatooine\"> Tatooine</a> in search of  R2-D2.  <br/> <br/>Luke Skywalker explores various locations throughout Tatooine, fighting numerous enemies including Jawas and Stormtroopers. The game features many locations from the movie including the Chalmun's Cantina in Mos Eisley where Luke meets Han Solo for the first time. This section of the game features a classic 8-bit rendition of the \"Cantina Band\" theme as played by the fictitious band, Figrin D'an and the Modal Nodes, in the feature film. The game also contains many famous lines from the movie including Obi-Wan Kenobi's plea to Luke to join him in his trip to Alderann and Han Solo's description of the smell from the Death Star's trash compactor.  <br/> <br/>The player eventually lands on the <a data-ref-id=\"3035-205\" href=\"/death-star/3035-205/\" slug=\"death-star\"> Death Star</a> and has to destroy the tractor beam to escape.

    "description": "<p>Robo Rumble was a simple Real Time Strategy game, with a key selling point for its release year of 1998: a 3D environment. The game was released on Windows PCs only, and is a straightforward affair. Players are challenged to beat enemies, and the game is condensed down to one resource: money. You may spend money on new units, and should enemies destroy the unit, you are refunded the value of that unit. The game includes a simplistic chat interface which is available between missions, which allows players to purchase new units and unit upgrades. The game was originally released in <a data-ref-id=\"3035-1722\" href=\"/poland/3035-1722/\"> Poland</a> under the name of 'Reflux'. </p>",

    "deck": "NBA Street V3 is the third entry in the popular NBA Street Series. Following in the footsteps of past games in the series, the game allows you to perform over the top dunks and tricks with your favorite NBA players.",
    "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">NBA Street V3 is the third game in <a href=\"/ea-sports-big/3010-6277/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6277\">EA Sports Big</a>'s style focused basketball series. It is the first game in the series to feature online play in the <a href=\"/playstation-2/3045-19/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-19\">Playstation 2</a> and <a href=\"/xbox/3045-32/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-32\">Xbox</a> versions. The game also includes a \"trick stick\" which allows players to perform crossovers with the right analog stick. Holding any of the turbo buttons while moving the trick stick allows for various moves. The more turbo buttons held down, the harder the trick the baller will try to perform. DJ <a href=\"/bobbito-garcia/3040-72953/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-72953\">Bobbito Garcia</a> returns as the game's announcer.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><a href=\"/gamebreaker/3015-9/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-9\">Gamebreakers</a> also received a major update from the previous games. When a gamebreaker is used inside the 3 point line, the player enters into a dunk mode almost identical to the system used in dunk contests. The player can use the trick stick to do mid-air tricks before finishing the gamebreaker or they can pass it to another baller who can continue the gamebreaker. Doing more tricks before finishing the gamebreaker translates into more points added to the player's score and subtracted from the opponents. If a player intiates a gamebreaker outside the 3 point line, the selected baller will shoot the ball for a minimum amount of points added and subtracted.</p><h3>Dunk Contests</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">During dunk contests, players can place obstacles in front of the rim(such as tables or even refrigerators), or bounce the ball off the backboard while moving the analog stick in mid air to perform different dunks. A panel of three judges each give scores from 1 to 10 based on the difficulty of the dunk.</p><h3>Creation Modes</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">NBA Sreet V3 features many creation modes, including returning ones as well as new ones. The character creator and team creator return from previous games in the series. New to the series are the shoe creator and the court creator.</p><h2>Soundtrack</h2><table><tbody><tr><th>Artist</th><th>Song Title</th></tr><tr><td>24K feat.

The goal of the series was to combine gameplay with learning, similar to many other \"edutainment\" games. The Math Blaster series originally began in 1983 and saw incremental improvements every few years to keep up with computer technology. Math Blaster: Episode 1 is the first in the series to be introduced to video game consoles: the game was released on the Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo in 1994. </p><p>The story follows Blasternaut as he flies through space converting trash into fuel and searching for his lost robot friend named Spot. Spot has been kidnapped by a yellow three-eyed trash alien who is wanted for \"space-dumping and Spotnapping\". The player must use basic addition and subtraction skills to progress through the game. There are several different levels within the game with different objectives, but they all boil down to basic arithmetic problems. The player can select the difficulty of the math problems as they increase in arithmetic ability, moving up to multiplication and division.</p><p>The game was followed by a sequel: <a href=\"/math-blaster-episode-2-secret-of-the-lost-city/3030-4183/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-4183\">Math Blaster: Episode 2: Secret of the Lost City</a>.

One example of the bad dialogue in this game may been seen <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLE7cM2ZI7w&amp;feature=related\" rel=\"nofollow\">     here</a>. <br /> <br /><h2>Gameplay<br /></h2> The gameplay style of Castle Shikigami 2 is your typical top down shoot. You have two types of regular shots and bombs.  There are also 5 levels of difficulty to choose from in the game so there will be a challenge for a long time to come. Multiplayer is the same as single player except you are both able to play through the story mode. Dialogue will also be different with each combination of character you choose.   <figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6384/388482-castleshik2ps2_001_large.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-388482\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.68412162162162\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:68.4%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6384/388482-castleshik2ps2_001_large.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-388482\"><img alt=\" Bullets!!! \" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6384/388482-castleshik2ps2_001_large.jpg\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/6384/388482-castleshik2ps2_001_large.jpg 592w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/6384/388482-castleshik2ps2_001_large.jpg 480w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6384/388482-castleshik2ps2_001_large.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption> Bullets!!! </figcaption></figure><br /> <br /><h3>Normal Attacks<br /></h3>To use the normal you can either rapidly press the square button or hold down the circle button (On the PS2 version). This will use the regular bullet attacks that is specific to your chosen character. <br /> <br /><h3>Mobile Light Force 3 Attack<br /></h3> The Mobile Light Force 3 attack is used by holding down the square button. This will use a alternate attack from your regular bullets and they are usually a close range attack. The advantages of useing this attack is that coin dropped from enemies will automatically be collected but your characters speed will decrease. <br /> <br /><h3>Special Attack<br /></h3> The special attack is your bomb attack. You will start off with 3 bombs every life and can hold up to a max of 5. During this attack you cannot be damaged, all enemies will be destroyed and bosses will take a large amount of damage. You will be able to regain a bomb at every 250,000,000 points. (You read that right)<br /> <br /><h3>Tension Bonus System<br /></h3> The Tension Bonus System works like the graze system in the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-606\" href=\"/touhou-project/3025-606/\">    Touhou</a> series of games. When you get really close to an enemy bullet your regular shots will turn red, cover a wider area on screen, and will also do more damage.

First released in arcades in 1984, the NES version was released in 1985. Unusually for a Nintendo developed property post the launch of the NES/Famicom, Balloon Fight was also ported to Japanese home computers the <a href=\"/nec-pc-8801/3045-109/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-109\">NEC PC88-01</a> and the <a href=\"/sharp-x1/3045-113/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-113\">Sharp X1</a>.</p><p>Gameplay consists of either one player or two-player co-op mode, and the goal of the main game is to defeat all enemies on screen to clear each level. The player is given three lives at the beginning of each game. There is also a Balloon Trip mode that tasks a player's reflexes by presenting an obstacle course full of hazards.</p><p>The game was later added to the Wii Virtual Console, the Wii U Virtual Console and the 3DS eShop. It is also present in the first <a href=\"/nes-remix/3030-44783/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-44783\">NES Remix</a> from indieszero as one of the featured games.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15568/625746-balloon_fight_25.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-625746\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 512px\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"512\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15568/625746-balloon_fight_25.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-625746\"><img alt=\"The Main Game Mode\" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15568/625746-balloon_fight_25.png\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/15568/625746-balloon_fight_25.png 512w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/15568/625746-balloon_fight_25.png 480w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15568/625746-balloon_fight_25.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>The Main Game Mode</figcaption></figure><p>The player character is a person with two balloons strapped to their back. The player must hit either the A or B buttons to flap the character's hands to fly about the stage, attacking enemies by landing on their backs and popping their balloons. Enemies are defeated by popping both of their balloons, and then landing on them while they are on the ground (in order to prevent them from inflating another balloon). There is also a body of water in the center of each level. If an enemy or player falls into the water or floats too close to the water, a large fish jumps from the water and eats the character. A spinning bumper-blade appears in the later levels as an added obstacle.</p><p>Between every three normal levels, a bonus stage occurs. In the bonus stage, the player attempts to burst a large number of balloons as they float up from the bottom of the screen. If all 20 balloons are collected, a large bonus is added to the player's score. Following each bonus stage, the player is also rewarded with a full complement of two balloons.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15568/625711-balloon_fight_9.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-625711\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 512px\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"512\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15568/625711-balloon_fight_9.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-625711\"><img alt=\"Balloon Trip\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15568/625711-balloon_fight_9.png\" data-srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/15568/625711-balloon_fight_9.png 512w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/15568/625711-balloon_fight_9.png 480w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15568/625711-balloon_fight_9.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Balloon Trip\" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15568/625711-balloon_fight_9.png\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/15568/625711-balloon_fight_9.png 512w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/15568/625711-balloon_fight_9.png 480w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15568/625711-balloon_fight_9.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Balloon Trip</figcaption></figure><p>The game also features a single-player mode called \"Balloon Trip\" where the player moves across a side-scrolling level, avoiding lightning bolts and gathering balloons.

    "description": "<h2>Overview</h2> Crypt of Medea is one of the early text-based adventure games to use graphics, however, the game still uses text commands like the traditional style of adventure games in that era. <br/>The goal of the game was to escape from Medea's crypt. To do so, the player must use a variety of items and avoid falling victim to a number of enemies and traps. <br/> <br/><h2>Plot</h2><blockquote><p> After falling unconscious during a late night drive, the unnamed protagonist wakes up in a unfamiliar tomb. This tomb is the crypt of Medea, and it is filled with hostile creatures and deadly traps. The protagonist is forced to explore the crypt in hopes of escaping.   </p></blockquote>~ From the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypt_of_Medea\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia</a> page.   <br/>                               <br/>      Unfortunately not much else is explained throughout the game. The player never finds out how the protagonist ended up in the tomb or why. The game provides no back-story on Medea or why she antagonises the protagonist. In fact Medea never appears in the game, the only evidence of her existence is an inscription that she wrote.<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/60173/1477658-filecrypt_of_medea.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1477658\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.68683274021352\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:68.7%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/60173/1477658-filecrypt_of_medea.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1477658\"><img alt=\"The only appearance of Medea.      \" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/6/60173/1477658-filecrypt_of_medea.png\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/6/60173/1477658-filecrypt_of_medea.png 562w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/60173/1477658-filecrypt_of_medea.png 480w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/6/60173/1477658-filecrypt_of_medea.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>The only appearance of Medea.      </figcaption></figure>      <br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2> The game has several different sections, with each section is represented with a picture and description. Objects and creatures that the player can interact with are always visible in the picture and are described in the text description. The player is able to move from on section to another by moving in cardinal directions or occasionally through other actions.   <br/>The Primary gameplay mechanic of Crypt of Medea is the use of items. Items can be found in many locations throughout the game, but the protagonist can only hold a certain number of items at any given time. Often items are necessary to overcoming the challenges the game offers the protagonist (puzzles, enemies.) Since the player has limited inventory space, managing which items to carry plays a crucial role in the game. <br/> <br/><h2>Reception</h2> Crypt of Medea upon release was considered a fairly graphic and adult game due in part to it's detailed descriptions of violent deaths. However, despite the mature content the game was enjoyed by several critics.  ",

    "description": "<div class=\"text\"><strong><u>Overview<br/></u></strong>This series of mini-games is linked together by a board game style quest to rescue the twin princesses, Mish and Mosh, who were kidnapped by villains. There are a total of nineteen different mini-games in Hodj and Podj. Each game gives the player clues, money or some items that they will need to rescue the twin princesse. The user has preordained knowledge of what each game has to offer him, and can choose accordingly.<br/>The game is set up like a board game, and the user will be asked to roll a pair of dice and move the corresponding number on the playing board. The board contains many tiles that link the mini-games together. The player can choose which mini-game to gravitate toward, based on what he perceives he needs to complete his quest. The user can play as either of the two princes, Hodj and Podj, both of whom want to rescue the princesses and be placed on the throne of the land of Po-Porree. The name of the game is derived from the names of these characters, and it is also a play on the phrase “Hodge Podge\". The games can also be played apart from the quest mode for users who are just intrigued by the play and do not care about the story line.<br/></div><br/>",

The player must use a light gun to kill all the aliens and zombies in the Area 51 facility without killing any other STAARS members.

Only the Saturn port was well received.</p><p>A typical light gun game in most respects, Area 51 is notable for using <a href=\"/digitized-sprites/3015-2288/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2288\">digitized sprites</a> over pre-rendered 3D environments, similar to other Midway games of the time like Mortal Kombat.</p><p>The Area 51 license was resurrected in 2005, when Midway released a first-person shooter bearing the <a href=\"/area-51/3030-4301/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-4301\">same name</a>, which was loosely based on the events of the original game.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Monty on the Run is the third game in the Gremlin Graphics series of platformers starring Monty Mole. After his escape from prison in the last game, the player is tasked with assisting his escape from the UK to Europe. Monty must avoid all the enemies, find the correct items needed to escape and make it onto the ship leaving England.</p><h2>Music</h2><p>The main theme for the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-14\" href=\"/commodore-64/3045-14/\">Commodore 64</a> version, produced by <a data-ref-id=\"3040-2834\" href=\"/rob-hubbard/3040-2834/\">Rob Hubbard</a>, is widely regarded as one of the best songs ever made for the system. The song also appears in the game <a data-ref-id=\"3030-22845\" href=\"/i-wanna-be-the-guy/3030-22845/\">I Wanna Be The Guy</a> as the theme to Guy's castle.</p><h2>Famicom Disk System Port</h2><p>In 1987, Jaleco procured the rights to publish Monty on the Run in Japan on the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-91\" href=\"/famicom-disk-system/3045-91/\">Famicom Disk System</a>. Rather than stay close to the source material, like they did with their port of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-2300\" href=\"/knight-lore/3030-2300/\">Knight Lore</a>, Monty on the Run was drastically changed for this release.</p><p>Renamed Monty no Doki Doki Daisassou, or \"Monty's Heart-Pounding Great Escape\", the game plays much more like a straightforward NES platformer. The goal is to search caverns to find tiles with parts of the true culprit's face - forming the full image at the end will get Monty off the hook.</p><p>It still retains some aspects of the original, such as a version of Hubbard's famous theme and obtaining necessary escape items. Monty (though now a human) still flips while jumping like the original Monty did.</p>",

This installment in the franchise continues the flight simulator themes with arcade style gameplay. Flight missions are given on four different stages, with the player able to choose from six different characters. Three different vehicles are also available for standard missions; the Hang Glider, Rocket Belt and Gyrocopter.</p><h2>Mission Structure</h2><p>Specific mission goals depend on the class of vehicle, however most missions follow the formula of takeoff, task completion and proper landing. Tasks vary from flying through a series of floating rings, to landing on checkpoints, and to taking judged pictures. Missions are also usually based on a time limit, where points are detracted once the player exceeds the time allotted.</p><p>For each mission, 100 points are possible for a Perfect Score from the player. Badges are awarded for obtaining certain point levels, as in a Silver Badge is awarded for the Rocket Belt after passing an average of 80 points or higher on each Rocket Belt mission.</p><p>When landing is required, the player is judged on impact and accuracy. Too hard of an impact anywhere in the level will cause the pilot to crash the plane and the mission to be failed. After each failure, the game offers textual tips for improving the player’s piloting skills.</p><p>Each level of difficulty for the classes of vehicles is designated to a specific island, all four of which display unique traits. The player is also free to choose any character at any given time, which are separated into light, medium, and heavy pilots.</p><h2>Pilots</h2><p>The pilots’ names are taken from bird names in the American version of the game. The lightweight pilots are <a href=\"/kiwi/3005-9132/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-9132\">Kiwi</a>, the girl, and <a href=\"/lark/3005-9127/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-9127\">Lark</a>, the boy. These are ideal for the Rocket Belt, as they display an increased maneuverability and speed. The medium weight pilots are <a href=\"/ibis/3005-9128/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-9128\">Ibis</a>, the woman, and <a href=\"/goose/3005-9130/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-9130\">Goose</a>, the man, both of which are suited for the Hang Glider. The heaviest pilots, the woman <a href=\"/robin/3005-9131/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-9131\">Robin</a>, and <a href=\"/hawk/3005-9129/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-9129\">Hawk</a>, the male, are best fitted for the Gyrocopter.</p><h2>Vehicle Classes</h2><p>The analog stick controls the Hang Glider’s movement, while an additional button can flare the glider’s wings for speed adjustments. Pilots must ensure they stay in the air long enough to complete the tasks while also landing properly. Hot air columns allow the Hang Glider to receive a significant amount of lift. Photography is also designated to Hang Glider missions, with each photo being stored in the photo album.</p><p>The Rocket Belts are more complicated than the Hang Gliders, allowing the player to control a jet pack that sends the player hovering at high altitudes and high speeds. Two buttons are designated to different amounts of thrust, one at full engine power, and the other at half. Hovering is also possible by the trigger button, allowing precise pilot movement, proving the Rocket Belt to be a favorite among many players.</p><p>The Gyrocopter takes off and lands similar to an airplane, with in flight controls responding similarly. Extremely low speeds are possible due to the helicopter fashioned design, but high speeds are also easily attainable during timed missions. The Gyrocopter is also equipped with a missile launcher while players have access to an unending supply of missiles. These are often used to either hit practice targets, or defeat the only enemy in the game, the Godzilla-like “Meca Hawk.”</p><h2>Additional Modes</h2><p>The Birdman mode equips pilots with bird-like wings attached to their arms. During these stages, the player is free to explore the island at their leisure, as this is not a timed mission, nor are there any tasks. The different weather modes are also available, ranging in sunny, cloudy, evening and night.</p><p>Sky Diving is also another mode where the pilots must complete in air formations with a following parachute landing on specific targets. The player only has a limited amount of time to complete each formation, as the altitude drops rapidly during the freefall.</p><p>A Cannonball mode lets players aim their pilot in a giant canon, and shoot them out towards a target, similarly to a circus clown as the missions’ soundtrack suggests.</p><p>The Jumble Hopper fits the pilots with oversized boots, propelling the pilot vertical and forward with force, as the goal is to reach the destination in as few hops as possible. Landing in river water will not cause the player to crash, however, points will be deducted from the final score.</p><h2>Locations</h2><p>Holiday Island is the starting location for each class of vehicle. This island is the smallest in the game, featuring attractions such as an amusement park complete with a Ferris wheel, and a mountaintop mansion.</p><p>Crescent Island features a beach location, as well as an extensive cave system cutting through its main mountain ridge. Many coastal homes can be seen on the outskirts of the island, while the inside features resorts, complete with pools and tennis courts. Luxury liners also inhabit the waters nearby.</p><p>Ever-Frost Island is an island permanently covered in snow, featuring tall peaks and sharp vertical drops.

    "deck": "This sequel to the Dreamcast cult classic delivers 60s sci-fi style in spades. Funky space reporter Ulala delivers her trademark dance grooves while saving the galaxy from the dastardly Rhythm Rogues!",
    "description": "<h2>Overview</h2>Space reporter <a data-ref-id=\"3005-31\" href=\"/ulala/3005-31/\">Ulala</a> is back on the scene with a thrilling sequel to <a data-ref-id=\"3030-7466\" href=\"/space-channel-5/3030-7466/\">Space Channel 5</a> that improves on the original in every conceivable way. Sega delivers improved music, expanded game mechanics and oodles of the 60s sci-fi style that made Space Channel 5 a cult classic, despite the low sales.   <br /> <br />Space Channel 5: Part 2 was originally released on <a data-ref-id=\"3045-37\" href=\"/dreamcast/3045-37/\">Dreamcast</a> in Japan, but was not brought to the United States. Fortunately for fans, <a data-ref-id=\"3010-39\" href=\"/agetec-inc/3010-39/\">Agetec</a> released a double pack of the Dreamcast games for <a data-ref-id=\"3045-19\" href=\"/playstation-2/3045-19/\">Playstation 2</a>. The emulation was perfect, which was surprising given the budget price of $20 for the game. In 2011, the game was released as a digital download on <a data-ref-id=\"3015-718\" href=\"/steam/3015-718/\">Steam</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3045-86\" href=\"/xbox-live-marketplace/3045-86/\">Xbox Live Marketplace</a> as a part of the <a data-ref-id=\"3030-33847\" href=\"/dreamcast-collection/3030-33847/\">Dreamcast Collection</a>.<br /> <br /><h2>Story</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/63573/1360629-screen_shot_2010_05_02_at_9.38.19_pm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1360629\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 518px\" data-ratio=\"0.76833976833977\" data-width=\"518\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:76.8%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/63573/1360629-screen_shot_2010_05_02_at_9.38.19_pm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1360629\"><img alt=\"The Rhythm Rouges have invaded the galaxy, and are forcing people to dance!  \" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/6/63573/1360629-screen_shot_2010_05_02_at_9.38.19_pm.png\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/6/63573/1360629-screen_shot_2010_05_02_at_9.38.19_pm.png 518w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/63573/1360629-screen_shot_2010_05_02_at_9.38.19_pm.png 480w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/6/63573/1360629-screen_shot_2010_05_02_at_9.38.19_pm.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>The Rhythm Rouges have invaded the galaxy, and are forcing people to dance!  </figcaption></figure>     The galaxy is threatened yet again by evildoers with wicked dance moves! This time, the robotic Rhythm Rogues have kidnapped over 300,000 people throughout the galaxy! The villainous Purge kidnaps Space President Peace and demands a ransom of 6.6 trillion space dollars which must be delivered to point Double X! Intrepid reporter Ulala is back on the scene, and will get to the bottom of the story with her funky dance moves.  <br /> <br />To get the scoop, Ulala must reunite with the characters of the first Space Channel 5, including Jaguar, Pudding and Space Michael! New allies like Pine, a member of the Sexy Space Police are there to help her. With a whole new cast of bosses to dance battle, Ulala will need every bit of help.  <br /> <br /><br /><h2>Gameplay</h2>Space Channel 5 is a variant of the 80s electronic game \"Simon Says,\" where players must match the commands in rhythm to the music.  For example, a captured character might request the sequence, \"Up, down, up, down, chu, chu, chu!\" Players would have to press \"Up, down, up, down, X, X, X\" in rhythm to the music. To succeed, a sense of rhythm and a good memory are key. Often, on screen cues remind the player of the sequence. For instance, two chu commands would be visually indicated with two robots. If the sequence is correctly entered, the player is rewarded with seeing the robots blasted. <br /> <br />This sequel introduces several new gameplay mechanics that make the experience more complex. A \"Recuse\" beam is added to Ulala's arsenal, which is activated with the circle button. The beam is used to rescue hostages. If the button is not pressed at the correct time, the hostage is not rescued and they are not added to the list of biographies on the title screen.  <br /> <br />The second gameplay mechanic that has been added is the hold function. For instance, Ulala might get the command sequence \"Chu! Chu! Chuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu! Chu!\" Ulala would have to hold the X button on the third input for the correct amount of time.  <br /> <br /><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/63573/1360645-screen_shot_2010_05_02_at_9.45.50_pm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1360645\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 513px\" data-ratio=\"0.77387914230019\" data-width=\"513\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:77.4%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/63573/1360645-screen_shot_2010_05_02_at_9.45.50_pm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1360645\"><img alt=\"A Morolian pops on screen when the correct secret command is inputed \" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/6/63573/1360645-screen_shot_2010_05_02_at_9.45.50_pm.png\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/6/63573/1360645-screen_shot_2010_05_02_at_9.45.50_pm.png 513w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/63573/1360645-screen_shot_2010_05_02_at_9.45.50_pm.png 480w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/6/63573/1360645-screen_shot_2010_05_02_at_9.45.50_pm.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>A Morolian pops on screen when the correct secret command is inputed </figcaption></figure>     Secrets have been added to the gameplay, which boost Ulala's ratings. The key is to hit X at the correct time in the cutscenes. For example, on the first stage if you press X for the second and third notes of the \"Mexican Flyer\" opening theme song, Morolians pop out of the edges of the screen and Ulala gets a boost to her ratings. Finding secrets is not critical for success, but does give the player more room to make mistakes in boss battles.  <br /> <br />Rather than having a set number of hearts, or allowable mistakes during boss battles - the number is calculated based on her ratings. This is a major change from the original game, and makes the gameplay before the boss sequences more important. Do well and you will have plenty of extra chances should you make a mistake. Do poorly and expect to repeat the level.  <br /> <br />Also, in the original, enemies popped in after the end of every sequence, requiring Ulala to blast them with an single Chu command. This is largely the same, but instead of blasting them Ulala strikes a funky dance pose.<br /><h2>Characters  </h2><b><a data-ref-id=\"3005-31\" href=\"/ulala/3005-31/\">Ulala</a></b> <br /><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/63573/1360566-screen_shot_2010_05_02_at_9.15.25_pm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1360566\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 518px\" data-ratio=\"0.75675675675676\" data-width=\"518\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.7%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/63573/1360566-screen_shot_2010_05_02_at_9.15.25_pm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1360566\"><img alt=\"Ulala poses with her trademark microphone\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/6/63573/1360566-screen_shot_2010_05_02_at_9.15.25_pm.png\" data-srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/6/63573/1360566-screen_shot_2010_05_02_at_9.15.25_pm.png 518w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/63573/1360566-screen_shot_2010_05_02_at_9.15.25_pm.png 480w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/6/63573/1360566-screen_shot_2010_05_02_at_9.15.25_pm.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Ulala poses with her trademark microphone\" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/6/63573/1360566-screen_shot_2010_05_02_at_9.15.25_pm.png\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/6/63573/1360566-screen_shot_2010_05_02_at_9.15.25_pm.png 518w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/63573/1360566-screen_shot_2010_05_02_at_9.15.25_pm.png 480w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/6/63573/1360566-screen_shot_2010_05_02_at_9.15.25_pm.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Ulala poses with her trademark microphone</figcaption></figure>     The heroine of Space Channel 5, who the player almost always controls.

Still, reviews were favorable. IGN gave Space Channel 5 a 7.4 and praised its budget price of $20. Reviewer Douglass Perry noted, \"It's a steal. If you have any mind for music games, you need Space Channel 5. \" <br /> <br />Gamespot was more mixed in its analysis, giving the game a 6.9. Reviewer <a data-ref-id=\"3040-89869\" href=\"/brad-shoemaker/3040-89869/\">Brad Shoemaker</a> mused, \"It's a little rough around the edges, but Ulala is still swinging.\" He went on to praise the style of the game. \"Every so often you run into a game that's a little short on gameplay, but so long on quirky appeal that you can't help loving it.\"",

    "description": "<div><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>Soldner X is a horizontal scrolling shooter, with 12 different levels, a weapon upgrade system, and trophies. The game was originally released on December 14th 2007 and was released to positive reception by the press with an average rating of 68 on Metacritic (It is important to note that one of the reviews was an outlier and without it the average score is 10 points higher, a 78). The game was slated for release on the PSN alongside the PC version, however it suffered many delays. It was then announced via a press report that an updated version of the game would be released on the PSN October 30th but this was delayed as well. The game was released on December the 4th 2008, almost a complete year after the originally scheduled date. The new PSN version is updated with 1080p High-Definition graphics, 2 player co-op support, and trophies. This game has a total of 13 trophies (1 gold, 3, silver, 9 bronze, 3 of these are hidden). </span></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><br/></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">You play the part of a nameless mercenary and bounty hunter who has been given control of a ship, Soldner-X ( the X most likely from the fact that the ship was the tenth prototype of its kind) which was created to try and defeat an enemy which has come fromn the planet <span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"color:rgb(229, 229, 229); \">Conceyta and its' moon and <span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"color:rgb(255, 255, 255); \">assimilates both living things and technology.  You are the last pilot and have been given the task of getting to and destorying the core of the enemy.  The tow basic weapons of the Soldner-X are the Pulse and Beam, the pulse being just what the name implies while the beam looks like arcing lightning.  You also get the Bow, Flame, and Rocket.  The Bow arcs all shots towards the middle of the screen while the Flame is a short but destuctive weapon.  The rocket is the most usefull with homing capabilities, but you have to pick up ammo thoughout the levels.  The are 24 different items to pickup with 3 being bad, 20 being good, and one that helps unlock benefis if you collect 5 of them in each world.  The are 4 worlds with 16 stages.</span></span></p></div>",

    "deck": "Rare survival horror title for the Dreamcast. Despite being financially unsuccessful, the game earned a cult following for its notable combination of atypical gameplay elements (e.g. trap detection) and bizarre B-movie style comedy-horror themes, dialogue and voice acting.",
    "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>illBleed is an over-the-top comedic horror game developed by Climax Graphics and released for the Sega Dreamcast in 2001. The game has players take control of horror fan Eriko Christy and, later, her classmates, as they try and survive a horror-themed amusement park filled with booby traps in order to win a hundred million dollar prize.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>The gameplay in illBleed stands out from other Survival Horror titles by making players pay extremely close attention to their environment. The bulk of the gameplay involves finding traps in the environment using a \"horror monitor\" device found early in the game, then marking the traps so you are not attacked and/or scared by them when you come into contact with them. Triggering an unmarked trap causes players to become wounded, lose strength, or become scared. If a player is wounded they must heal themselves or risk bleeding to death, whereas getting too scared can cause a player to be scared to death. Marking a trap, however, uses up the player's adrenaline. Adrenaline is regained by marking a trap that is actually a trap and not some random feature in the environment, or by using status recovery items.</p><p>Another feature unique to illBleed is its battle mode. When the player comes in contact with an enemy an RPG-esque battle system is initiated. Battles are fought in real time, but are confined to a small battle area the player cannot leave. If the player absolutely must flee from an enemy they can call for a helicopter by standing on a green square and pressing a button. Keep in mind that the vast majority of this game takes place indoors.</p><p>Throughout the various levels the player will come in contact with members of Eriko's horror film club, who will be in need of rescuing. After rescuing a character they become selectable in the game.</p><h2>Story</h2><p>An intro using the in-game engine sets the scene as main character Eriko gives a speech for a high school speech contest, in which she explains her obsession with horror movies. Eriko, whose father used to be a designer for a popular horror theme park, is revealed to be the president of a horror movie club at her school and has a predictably troubled past, coming from a broken home and having been simultaneously traumatized and fixated on her father's work in the horror field.</p><p>The player is then introduced to the members of Eriko's horror movie club, all of whom can be player controller later in the game. One of her friends, Michel, tells the group about a new horror-themed amusement park, Illbleed, and conveniently has invitations to the park's grand opening. He also reveals that the first person to make it out of the park alive will be awarded a hundred million dollars by the owner of the park. All of the members of the club are excited, save for Eriko, who is convinced that the park will be lame as hell. The horror movie club, minus their fearless leader, set off for Illbleed.</p><p>A day passes. Then multiple days pass. The horror movie club has not returned. You can probably figure out that something horrible has happened.</p><p>Worried for her friends' safety, Eriko winds up going to Illbleed, and, as the game's psuedo-infamous trailer claims, \"you will SHIT with FEAR\".</p><h2>Levels</h2><p>Each level is set up as its own mini-horror film, often times spoofing real horror films.</p><h3>Homerun of Death</h3><p>Taking place in the charred remains of a hotel, Homerun of Death tasks players with dealing with Gale Banbollow, the former owner of the aforementioned hotel. Banbollow packs a flamethrower and is out to avenge the death of his baseball-loving son Jimmy, who was burned to death in the basement of the hotel when juvenile delinquents burnt it down.</p><h3>The Revenge of Queen Worm</h3><p>This level takes place in an abandoned campground and tasks players with helping a ghost kill his massive pet worm.</p><h3>Woodpuppets</h3><p>An angry tree spirit takes over a wood mill, kills the owner, and turns the mill's employees into an army of \"woodpuppets\". The player must destroy the mill and, of course, the \"woodpuppets\".</p><h3>Killer Department Store</h3><p>A haunted department store hides vindictive, possessed merchandise.</p><h3>Killerman</h3><p>IT'S A MURDER MYSTERY!</p><h3>Toyhunter</h3><p>In one of the most bizzare segments in any videogame ever released, the player takes control of Cork Inda, a literal composite of Woody from the Toy Story films and Indiana Jones. Cork's love interest, Sexy Doll, has been cast into Toy Hell, and now he must save her from eternal damnation. Of course, it's not as easy as it sounds, and Cork winds up fighting Zodick the Hellhog, who looks like a composite of Reagan from The Exorcist and Sonic the Hedgehog.</p><h3>The Final Battle</h3><p>Exactly what it sounds like. The player battles the man who owns the theme park and one of his grotesque monsters.</p><h2>Legacy</h2><p>Despite having all the makings of a cult hit, illBleed fell victim to its own eccentricness and the horrible timing of its US release, which occured near the end of the Dreamcast's lifespan. An enhanced port for the Xbox was announced by the game's developers but never materialized. A homebrew sequel entitled illBleed 2: Reynold's Revenge, was announced a year or so after the original game's release by Lucky S Designs, but the website was taken down in 2006.</p><p>Hopes for an official illBleed sequel were destroyed in 2004 when the vast majority of the game's programming team quit following the merger of Climax, by then known as Crazy Games, with another, much larger company. Climax Graphics/Crazy Games CEO Shinya Nishigaki died of a heart attack shortly after this incident.</p><h2>Links</h2><p><a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20050127005712/illbleed.lucky-s-designs.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Lucky S Design's illBleed 2 page (via the Way-Back Machine)</a></p>",

Uniquely, these graphics were highly compressed, allowing for every location to have its own image rather than just a select few as was typical of rival interactive fiction game of the time.</p><p> </p><h2>Plot</h2><p>The game picks up from the end of <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/snowball/3030-12287/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-12287\">Snowball</a> with protagonist Kim Kimberley having successfully saved the ship Snowball 9 and its crew awakened as it orbits the planet Eden. Unfortunately the crew now suspect Kim of having been the saboteur based on circumstantial evidence of the control room cameras and sentence her to death.</p><p>Kim manages to escape to the planets surface and so becomes the first human to arrive there, where robots have been attempting to build a city for the colonists despite the hostile alien plant life of Eden's jungle constantly disrupting their efforts. </p><p>This battle has led to the robots becoming somewhat erratic, and when the colonists attempt to use the damaged starships main drive to burn Kim on the surface they interpret this as a hostile action.</p><p> </p>",

Despite (or perhaps because of) the primitive graphics, this constant refinement over decades has resulted in gameplay of great depth and variety.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2891/936338-screen4.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-936338\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 660px\" data-ratio=\"0.51515151515152\" data-width=\"660\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:51.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2891/936338-screen4.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-936338\"><img alt=\"Death lurks around every corner.\" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2891/936338-screen4.png\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/2891/936338-screen4.png 660w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2891/936338-screen4.png 480w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2891/936338-screen4.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Death lurks around every corner.</figcaption></figure><p>While the game ostensibly rotates around the staples of character statistics, combat, inventory, and spells, the player will find that strung along the randomly-generated dungeons are key places and creatures that present an emergent narrative without requiring wordy exposition, gently directing or distracting the player from the overarching quest to retrieve the hoary old Amulet of Yendor.</p><p>Death, or indeed any action in the game, is final. The player cannot revert to a previous save point. The game is saved on exit and deleted when reloaded. Otherwise, saved games are inaccessible to the player. Every action the player takes is therefore irrevocable. Since a single game may easily last days or weeks, it is rarely worth starting over, no matter what setback in encountered, and so the player must learn to live with his failures as well as his successes, and tremendous emotion may be invested in the precious avatar.</p><p>While there is no plot, per se, the character is tasked with delving into the dungeon, retrieving the Amulet of Yendor, bringing it to a god's altar in heaven, and sacrificing it; after players do that, they \"ascend\" (essentially, winning). Doing this is much easier said than done, especially without the use of spoilers (which are generally frowned upon in the hardcore community).</p><p>The gameplay is absolutely ruthless. The gods of the <a href=\"/random-number-generation/3015-816/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-816\">Random Number Generator</a> will throw multitudes of chaotic, overlapping situations toward the player, which may result in immediate death for the unwary adventurer. From mineral-digesting worms that eat through walls, to moments quietly training pets to shoplift items from within the shop, to looking forlornly at the wand that could easily save the day if only the player still had arms to pick it up, there is never a dull moment. However, for every pinnacle of triumph, achievement, and joy, there are depths of anguish, terror, and frustration. In many ways, this is the reason NetHack captures the imagination of so many - it does not try to please the player. It simply exists by its own set of rules. Players contort to accommodate them if they are to have any chance of survival.</p><h2>Graphics</h2><p>There are a variety of graphical interfaces through which the game may be played, from simple text terminals, tile-based hand-drawn graphics, to 3-D <a href=\"/isometric-viewpoint/3015-246/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-246\">isometric</a> representations (i.e. <a href=\"/nethack-falcons-eye/3030-2808/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2808\">Falcons Eye</a>). Although these all present the same underlying gameplay, expert players tend to prefer the simpler interfaces for their clarity, responsiveness, and ability to be driven entirely via keyboard.</p><h2>Notes</h2><ul><li>There is an annual NetHack championship, held at <a href=\"http://nethack.devnull.net\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://nethack.devnull.net</a>, which starts at midnight on Halloween, and lasts through the month of November.</li><li>NetHack is a free download, from <a href=\"http://www.nethack.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.nethack.org</a>, and it runs on all types of computers. Players can also play it online at nethack.alt.org via telnet.</li><li>With over 26 years of development and counting, NetHack is one the few games that has a fanbase that is largely younger than itself.</li><li>Since the 8th of December, 2003 development of Nethack has ceased.</li></ul>",

    "deck": "Close Combat V returns to the roots of the series and lets the player storm or defend the beaches of Normandy during the D-Day once again.",
    "description": "<p>Close Combat: Invasion Normandy (often reffered to as Close Combat V) is the last game in the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-658\" href=\"/close-combat/3025-658/\">franchise</a> made by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-234\" href=\"/atomic-games-inc/3010-234/\">Atomic Games</a> and published by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-34\" href=\"/strategic-simulations-inc/3010-34/\">SSI</a>. The game puts the player on the beaches and hedges of Cotentin Penisula during the 1944 Operation Overlord (starting with the D-Day) and allows the player to play as the allied invasion forces or the defending axis. It is regarded as the best in the series, as it refinded the gameplay elements from all of the previous iterations, improved units pathfinding and the strategic map (which first appeared in <a data-ref-id=\"3030-11591\" href=\"/close-combat-iv-the-battle-of-the-bulge/3030-11591/\">Close Combat IV</a>).</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>The game is divided into two parts - <a data-ref-id=\"3015-192\" href=\"/turn-based/3015-192/\">turn based</a> strategic map phase, where the player moves the whole battalions of troops on a large map of the Cotentin penisula, and the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2332\" href=\"/real-time-combat/3015-2332/\">real-time</a> tactical part, when the units who encounter the enemy can be ordered during battle.</p><p>In the tactical part, which is the most recognizable feature of the whole franchise, the player controls squads of infantry, mortars, single armored vehicles and guns with a set of simple orders. He is also able to call down an artillery or aircraft support if it's available. The firefights consist of maximum 3 platoons on each side of conflict and are short, but intense. The battle can end in a victory (when the enemy forces rout due to the loss of morale or loss of every \"victory point\" on the map) and a total control of the location on the strategic map, a draw (when neither side gains the upper hand before the timer runs out, which is usually set to 15 minutes) which means that the battle will continue in the next strategic turn, or defeat (when our forces loose morale or all victory points) which means a destruction of the player's battalion on the strategic map.</p><p>Every single soldier in the battalion has it's own morale meter which can be changed by a number of factors - the closeness to the commander, taking a victory location or performing a brave act during battle can fill the hearts of the combatant and his fellow troops with hope, while the suppresion by enemy fire, loss of his comrades, seeing other troops retreating or an enemy vehicle approaching when there is no anti-tank measures available can cause a worse performance on the battlefield or evan a dessertion. Thus, the morale is the most important factor during the tactical phase and seasoned players could observe numerous times the rout of entire enemy platoons due to a lucky sniper shots elliminating the squad officers or a single well-placed machine gun stopping a whole infantry assault.</p><p>The batallions on the map have finite number of troops and player is encouraged to retreat them to the rear if the prolonged fighting during the campaign thins their numbers, as every single soldier gains experience individually and low quality replacements are no match for the veterans - sometimes a whole squad of replacement troops can surrender without even hearing a shot, which can be criplling to the morale of a whole force and in turn can cost the player a whole battle. In addition, even the best soldiers cannot fight without fuel and ammunition which they can only replenish if they have a road connection with a supply depot indicated on the strategic map. Thus, encircling a tough enemy during the strategic phase can turn the tide of battle in the tactical phase.</p><h2>Remake</h2><p>Invasion Normandy was remade (as well as the other Colse Combat games, excluding the first one) by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-996\" href=\"/matrix-games/3010-996/\">Matrix Games</a> and is sold under the title Close Combat: The Longest Day in a digital and phisical copy format. The remake left the graphics engine and the core gameplay in it's original form, changing only small details (like vehicle models and some tactical map fixes) and packed the game with a lot of mods, making the strategic map much bigger, adding more battlegroups and remodelling their size, troop composition and experience.</p><h2>Community</h2><p>The game (like all the previous Close Combats) still has a large following of die-hard strategy games fans who still make mods for it and still play the entire campaigns through the multiplayer.</p>",

In each of the levels it is divided into two different type of stages. In the first stage you control the Planeteers but either flying their Eco-Jet, Helicopter or Submarine to an enemy fortress. You try to avoid the instant death that occurs by touching any of the scenery or getting hit by the various birds or projectiles coming at you. You can interact with the environment (such as Ma-Ti's ability of talking to animals, you can beam help from such animals like a whale).</p><p>The second stage involves you controlling Captain Planet himself as he fights his way to an eco-villain from the original TV series. Then a final boss battle with said villain. The second stage changed from a side-scrolling shooter to a platformer.</p><h2>By their power combined:</h2><p>Throughout the game you will have the ability to use each of the Planeteers ability based on their power rings. Each one has a different purpose.</p><ul><li><b>Earth</b>- The ability to throw rocks</li><li><b>Fire</b>- Sends a fireball straight ahead.</li><li><b>Wind-</b> Makes a force field around you</li><li><b>Water-</b> Projectiles in a wave formation</li><li><b>Heart-</b> Summon animals to attack things.</li></ul>",

As <a href=\"/lucasarts-entertainment-company-llc/3010-644/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-644\">Lucasarts</a> began to redefine the parameters of Adventure gaming for the PC, the <a href=\"/\">Sierra</a> team followed suit, updating the original text-based interface used in <a href=\"/police-quest-in-pursuit-of-the-death-angel/3030-147/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-147\">Police Quest 1</a> and <a href=\"/police-quest-2-the-vengeance/3030-2912/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2912\">Police Quest 2</a> with the <a href=\"/sci/3015-1554/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1554\">Sierra Creative Interpreter (SCI)</a>, a <a href=\"/point-and-click/3015-75/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-75\">point-and-click</a> interface featuring controls for walking, looking, touching, speaking and an inventory. While the game did not require a mouse in order to play it, it was certainly recommended. Graphically, the game also saw improvements, moving from 16-color EGA graphics to 256-color VGA graphics (an EGA version of the game was also made available for purchase). Unlike the <a href=\"/\">Lucasarts</a> games, however, the player could still die if they did not successfully perform certain tasks, or initiated certain scenarios in the game. When doing this, the player would be visited by series creator <a href=\"/james-walls/3040-1753/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-1753\">Jim Walls</a>, one foot perched on the bumper of a squad car, who would briefly (and often sardonically) explain what had gone wrong.</p><p>A number of <a href=\"/sierra-entertainment-inc/3010-1030/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1030\">Sierra</a> staff members have Lytton Police Department Officers named after them, including <a href=\"/daryle-smith/3040-915/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-915\">Daryle Smith</a>, <a href=\"/juan-carlos-escobar/3040-878/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-878\">Carlos Escobar</a>, <a href=\"/maurice-morgan/3040-7061/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-7061\">Maurice Morgan</a>, <a href=\"/james-larsen/3040-1764/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-1764\">Jim Larsen</a>, <a href=\"/jon-bock/3040-1763/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-1763\">Jon Bock</a>, <a href=\"/jane-cardinal/3040-7069/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-7069\">Jane Cardinal</a>, <a href=\"/jeff-crowe/3040-1767/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-1767\">Jeff Crowe</a>, <a href=\"/mark-crowe/3040-997/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-997\">Mark Crowe</a>, Kimberly Eidson, <a href=\"/frank-ferrell/3040-1768/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-1768\">Frank Ferrell</a>, <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/desie-hartman/3040-2102/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-2102\">Desie Hartman</a>, <a href=\"/jane-jensen/3040-1771/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-1771\">Jane Jensen</a>, <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/cheryl-loyd/3040-1776/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-1776\">Cheri Loyd</a>, Robert Swafford, and the ever-present <a href=\"/james-walls/3040-1753/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-1753\">Jim Walls</a>. They are listed in the Department's personnel directory found on any of Sonny's various computers throughout the game. The listings are often accompanied by a humorous quip or inside joke.</p><p> </p><h2>Plot</h2><p>Lytton, once a quiet and peaceful little town, has been growing like a weed. There's new industry, good jobs, and a decent standard of living. Unfortunately, progress is not without its side effects. Poverty and crime are going up about as fast as the new cultural center.</p><p>Homicide Detective <a href=\"/\">Sonny Bonds</a> and his wife Marie (formerly Marie Wilkins in the previous <a href=\"/police-quest/3025-436/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-436\">Police Quest</a> games) are still on a \"honeymoon high\" from their wedding a few years back. Marie's got a good job at the Oak Tree Mall and the two have a beautiful new home. As for Sonny, he was promoted to Detective Sergeant with the Lytton Police Department.</p><p>The game begins with Sonny beginning a seemingly ordinary day on September 14th, 1991 at Lytton PD, returning to the force following the completion of his Sergeant's training. Overburdened as the department is, he's been assigned to Traffic Division for a bit. Seems Traffic's always understaffed. Sonny's day consists of such tasks as delivering the morning traffic duty briefing, investigating a citizen's complaint regarding a colleague, obtaining a new keycard for his office computer, and so forth.</p><p>After an afternoon of traffic duty, a cutscene appears showing the attempted murder of Marie Bonds in the parking lot of the Oak Tree Mall. The game then shifts to a murder investigation involving a serial killer, a satanic cult, illicit drugs, and a visit from an old nemesis. Immediately following the attack on his wife, Bonds is re-assigned from the Traffic Division to Homicide.</p><p> </p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>The game, along with the newly released <a href=\"/space-quest-iv-roger-wilco-and-the-time-rippers/3030-8024/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8024\">Space Quest IV</a> and <a href=\"/kings-quest-v-absence-makes-the-heart-go-yonder/3030-16771/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-16771\">King's Quest V</a>, showcased <a href=\"/\">Sierra</a>'s new <a href=\"/sci/3015-1554/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1554\">SCI</a> <a href=\"/point-and-click/3015-75/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-75\">point-and-click</a> interface, and is almost always displayed from an overhead, third-person perspective. Game progress is almost completely linear, and depends upon the player successfully performing a series of actions during game situations, usually in an inflexible order.</p><p>Most of the game's characters were modelled using an early form of motion-capture technology. Hired actors and Sierra staff were captured while performing against a blue screen, and were then used in the game.</p><p>The player was also introduced to a new driving system, involving a map of the city combined with a third-person view of the car, which allowed the user to accelerate, stop, and perform turns. The player was also required to turn the car's ignition on and off, as well as turning on the car's siren. Signs would pop up before intersections, alerting the player of which street they would soon approach.</p><p>Various tools related to police work were available during the course of the game. In one instance, the game asks that a composite sketch be constructed of Marie's attacker. In another situation, the player is required to plot several locations on a map of the city in order to find a pattern.</p><p>The game's combat controls were not terribly sophisticated, and generally involved selecting a weapon from the inventory, and clicking said item on an assailant. In its defense, combat situations are few and far between in Police Quest 3.</p><p>Police Quest 3 featured multiple endings, with only one good ending. If the player failed to address one crucial part of the game's several plot threads, they might not get the good ending, but rather a bad ending resembling the game's many death sequences (featuring Jim Walls and the squad car).</p><p>Police Quest 3 was scored by <a href=\"/jan-hammer/3040-1770/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-1770\">Jan Hammer</a> of Miami Vice fame. Hammer's soundtrack was designed to be heard through a Roland MT-32 sound module.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Overview</h2>Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 2: Bush Rescue is the second part of the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-250\" href=\"/ty-the-tasmanian-tiger/3025-250/\">   Ty the Tasmanian Tiger trilogy</a>, started with <a data-ref-id=\"3030-13169\" href=\"/ty-the-tasmanian-tiger/3030-13169/\">   Ty the Tasmanian Tiger</a>, and concluded with <a data-ref-id=\"3030-19188\" href=\"/ty-the-tasmanian-tiger-3-night-of-the-quinkan/3030-19188/\">   Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 3: Night of the Quinkan</a>. The game has the same core elements as the original, but new features, like driving and Arena battles. The game also changes from a level based system like the first game to a more structured, mission based game similar to <a data-ref-id=\"3030-10384\" href=\"/jak-ii/3030-10384/\">   Jak II</a>. The game features driving sectuions, and the main world is very large, and is acessed by driving around in a 4x4 Jeep. Indeed, driving elements make up a large part of the game, as some of the combat is fought in <a data-ref-id=\"3055-21\" href=\"/mech/3055-21/\">   mechs</a>. Some missions consist entirely of objective- based goals, like putting out a set number of fires with a helicopter. This game was recieved better than the first. It was produced by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-250\" href=\"/krome-studios-pty-ltd/3010-250/\">   Krome</a>  Studios and published by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-6256\" href=\"/ea-games/3010-6256/\">   EA Games</a>. It was released on the 12 October 2004 in North America, and on the 5 Novemeber 2004 for PAL Regions.<br /><h2>Story</h2> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/56/704261-ss_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-704261\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.74929577464789\" data-width=\"710\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 710px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.9%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/56/704261-ss_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-704261\"><img alt=\"Ty battles against a Frill Lizard mech in his Bunyip power suit.\" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/56/704261-ss_2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/56/704261-ss_2.jpg 710w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/56/704261-ss_2.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 710px) 100vw, 710px\" data-width=\"710\"></a><figcaption>Ty battles against a Frill Lizard mech in his Bunyip power suit.</figcaption></figure>Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 2: Bush Rescue is set in the Australian Outback, in a <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1855\" href=\"/hub-world/3015-1855/\">   hub world</a> called Burramudgee. Burramudgee is a significantly larger hub world than the original's Rainbow Cliffs, and features pedestrians who Ty can talk to, vehicles that are un-driveable, Bush rescue's base of operations, and a Driving garage where Sheila has parked the 4x4, and Ty can exit into the massive outside world. After Boss Cass breaks out of jail with the aid of Fluffy and her mech, he sets up his own community to grant himself 'Diplomatic Immunity', so Ty can't apprehend him without proof. Dennis sets up a rescue service called 'Bush rescue' to aid Ty in his attempt to bring Boss Cass to justice and help other civilians from Boss Cass's evil plans, which include making a race of Uber Lizards, taking control of Burramudgee, and absconding with the local population. Ty must race to save his family and friends once again.<br /><br /><h2>Gameplay</h2>Ty the tasmanian Tiger 2: Bush Rescue changes formula from the first, switching from a collection-based game to a misson-based platformer that has Ty traversing large spaces and bigger environments than the first,   <figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6393/394994-ty_tasmanian_tiger_2_bush_rescue_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-394994\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6393/394994-ty_tasmanian_tiger_2_bush_rescue_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-394994\"><img alt=\"Ty with the Lassorang\" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/6393/394994-ty_tasmanian_tiger_2_bush_rescue_2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/6393/394994-ty_tasmanian_tiger_2_bush_rescue_2.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></a><figcaption>Ty with the Lassorang</figcaption></figure>sometimes with the aid of friendly characters or vehicles. This game features mechs fairly heavily, and contains a lot of vehicle segments. This game also expands Ty's original aresenal of Boomerangs, but the player has to buy them now instead of collecting Golden Cogs. The boomerangs can also be upgraded to a second, stronger form, which increases the boomerangs usefulness.<br /> <br /><br />  <br /><h2>Characters</h2>The list of people in Ty 2 has been expanded featuring all of the old characters and some new faces.<br /><br /><h3> </h3> <h3>Ty  the Tasmanian Tiger:</h3>Ty is the main character of Ty 2: Bush Rescue, and is the head of said organisation. He will do anything to save his friends.<br /><h3>Sheila:</h3>Sheila is Ty's girlfriend, and plays a much more active role in this game, even accompanying Ty on some of his missions. She helps Ty in his final battle agains Boss Cass, and helps repel the Frill Lizard invaders of Burramudgee.  <h3>Julius:</h3>A mad scientist always after plutonium, Julius the Koala is Bush Rescue's resident mechanic/technician. He gives Ty some new gadgets, as well as giving him missions.<br /><h3>Sly:</h3>Originally evil, Sly the Tasmanian Tiger is Ty's best friend. As well as helping him out on missions, he will sell Boomerang upgrades to Ty if you can find him.<br /><h3>Ranger Ken:</h3>A park ranger who is utterly devoted to his work. He offers dangerous jobs like fling a helicopter to put out a forest fire and clearing crocodiles out from the sewers underneath Burramudgee.<br /><h3>Cheif Blinky:</h3>Cheif Blinky is a poilice officer who introduces Mechs to Ty. He gets wounded near the beginning, but recovers and is bent on seeing Boss Cass in Jail.<br /><h3>Ty's Parents:</h3>Ty's parents run a boomerang store that Ty can purchase all of his Level 1 boomerangs at. The shop is located in Burramudgee.<br /><h3>Ty's sister:</h3>Ty's sister and her boyfriend have opened a theme park in the billabong, and are short on visitors. They need help with a few problems, but only appear in the Billabong area.<br /><h3>Goobooberry Steve:</h3>Steve is addicted to Goobooberries, and if you find enough he will give you hundreds of Opals (Curreny) as well as reiterating his tales of woe about how he lost his Gooboo juice.<br /><h3>Fluffy:</h3>Fluffy is Boss Cass's replacement for Sly. She is a female Blue Tounge, and she is eaisily swayed by Opals. She is the instigator of most of the Boss Battles in the game, often luring Ty to an area that's in peril.<br /><h3>Boss Cass:</h3>He is Ty's arch nemesis, and plans to breed a race of warm-blooded Frill Lizards called Uber Lizards and use them to destroy Burramudgee and take over Southern Australia.<br /><h3>Dennis:</h3>Dennis is the founder of Bush Rescue, and is still as pompous as ever. He's become a master chef in the time since Ty the Tasmanian Tiger.<br /><h3>Maurie:</h3>Maurie has a relatively small part in this game, but he is the second in command of Bush Rescue.<br /><h3>Frill Lizards:</h3>Frill Lizards are just as pathetic as they were in the first game, only this time they have laser guns.<br /><h3>Uber Lizards:</h3>Warm blooded Frill Lizards, they can only be combated by either a mech or one of Sly's boomerangs.",

His father finds him reading a magic book in bed and in anger throws the book on the chalkboard pentagram the floor. This causes the book to catch alight and summons Sordid, who now seeks revenge on <a href=\"/simon-the-sorcerer/3005-1967/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1967\"> Simon the Sorcerer</a>. Sordid promises Runt that he can become his apprentice if he helps him capture Simon.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Meanwhile, Simon lives happily in his own world and completely unaware of Sordid's return. Sordid sends a wardrobe to trick Simon back to the magical world, but Sordid mistakenly made the wardrobe bring Simon to the doorstep of Calypso's Magic Shop, the wizard who Simon rescued in the first game. <a href=\"/calypso/3005-5337/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-5337\"> Calypso</a> tells Simon that in order to return home he must find the wardrobe's power source called Mucusade.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The gameplay is very similar to the first game, continuing to use a <a href=\"/point-and-click/3015-75/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-75\"> point-and-click</a> interface. The only difference is that there are now icons to represent possible verbs instead of words. For example, the first game had a 'talk to' button, but it has been replaced to an icon of a mouth.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"> </p><h2>Simon</h2><p>The voice of Simon is provided by Brian Bowles who replaces Chris Barrie. Simon's appearance also changes in this sequel with red wizard garbs replacing the purple set from the first game. Simon has also grown a pony-tail in the years in between the two games.</p>",

    "description": "<h3> </h3><h2>Features</h2>On the gridiron, NFL Football '94 featured authentic team playbooks, an improved passing game and increased speed bursts leading to many games being offensive slug-fests.  Other in game features included audibles, screen passes, 360 degree spins, diving catches and instant replays.<br/> <br/>Thanks to the 16mb battery powered save feature, NFL Football '94 Starring Joe Montana allowed users to play an entire 16 game Football season including the playoffs and the Superbowl.  Users could select team schedules from the 1991, 1992 and 1993 seasons. Battery backup allowed users to track team standings as well as league leaders in passing, rushing, sacks, etc.   Stats were presented in a weekly round up made to look like the pages of a newspaper called 'SEGA Sports Page',<br/> <br/>This game introduced a lower viewing angle while playing offense referred to as ''Behind the QB'', which would soon become the standard viewing angle for most NFL Football video games.  The camera system also featured a action-zoom feature which was met with middling reactions.  <br/> <br/>The play calling in this game was provided by Lon Simmons the  legendary sportscaster for both San Francisco's NFL and MLB franchises, the 49ers and Giants respectively.<br/><h2>Put On Your Game Face!</h2>As the game manual states; \"You thought '93 was intense? Then <i>NFL Football '94 Starring Joe Montana</i> will really blow your dome!\" ",

Instead of preventing <a href=\"/world-war-ii/3015-471/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-471\">World War II</a> they simply change it as <a href=\"/russia/3035-38/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-38\">Russia</a> invades Europe. Spies lurk, land mines wait, and strange new technologies aid both sides in their struggle for ultimate control. Many new technologies are used by Russia and the Allies including Tesla, the Chronosphere's <a href=\"/teleportation/3015-8/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-8\">teleport</a>, Iron Curtain's invulnerability and the Gap Generator's satellite surveillance blocking system. Ore, the most abundant and valuable resource on the planet, is the primary resource that funds the military might of the Soviets &amp; Allies.</p><p>The War over land and the resources it brings has gotten deadly in this alternate universe as the Soviet Union deploys Mammoth Tanks &amp; Tesla Coils to crush the allies. Not only does the war rage on land, but also in the air and on the oceans. The allies deploy devastating Destroyers &amp; Cruisers while the soviets deploy Submarines to counter the allies' massive navy. In the air the Allies deploy deadly Apache Helicopters while the Soviets deploy Yak &amp; MiG aircraft and helicopters of their own. It's up to the player to decide who will win Soviet Union or the Allied Forces. Command &amp; Conquer Red Alert gives you the opportunity to be more devious, cunning and ruthless than ever before.

    "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Mystic Ark is the third game made by Enix and Produce, after Elnard (<a href=\"/the-7th-saga/3030-20389/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20389\">The 7th Saga</a>) and <a href=\"/brain-lord/3030-1579/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1579\">Brain Lord</a>. It mutated the turn-based combat system and the party system from Elnard, while it inherited the emphasis on puzzles from Brain Lord.</p><h2>Characters</h2><h3>Heroes</h3><p>The main characters of the game, they are the only characters able to navigate the Shrine and the only characters able to turn monsters into figurines. They wear heavy armor and are proficient in the use of swords.</p><p>The player can choose the gender of the hero, which affects his/her abilities, status, and default name. They most likely came from the Green World.</p><h4>1) Lemele/Remeer the Hero</h4><p>The male protagonist is more oriented towards physical attributes. The attack spells he can learn are fire-elemental. (<em>He is similar to Olvan the Dwarf from the 7th Saga.</em>)</p><h4>2) Ferris/Fellis the Heroine</h4><p>The female protagonist is more oriented towards magical attributes. The attack spells she can learn are ice-elemental. She can learn more magic than Lemele/Remeer, especially healing and support spells. (<em>She is similar to Kamil the Human warrior from the 7th Saga.</em>)</p><h3>Spellcasting character classes</h3><h4>3) Meisia the Priestess</h4><p>A priestess (or White Mage), she is the main healer of the game. She can wear the same light armor as Miriene, the witch. The weapons she can use best are staves, but she should rather focus on magic. (<em>She is similar to Valsu the Human healer from the 7th Saga.</em>)</p><h4>4) Miriene the Witch</h4><p>She is a fairly balanced spellcaster, not specializing in anything in particular. She learns a wide array of spells with different effects, and she's especially useful with her support and debuff skills. She can wear the same light armor as Meisia, the priestess. The weapons she can use best are knives, but she should rather focus on magic. (<em>She is similar to Esuna the Elf girl from the 7th Saga.</em>)</p><h4>5) Kamiwoo the Ogre</h4><p>This character (a Black Mage) is best used for his offensive spells. His choice of armor is limited. The weapons he can use best are axes. (<em>He is similar to Lejes the Demon from the 7th Saga.</em>)</p><h3>Physical character classes</h3><h4>6) Reeshine the Grappler</h4><p>She specializes in strong melee attacks. The weapons she can use best are nunchuks and boomerangs. She can wear her own martial arts suits for protection. (<em>She is similar to Wilme the Alien from the 7th Saga.</em>)</p><h4>7) Lux the Tetsujin</h4><p>\"Tetsu-jin\" is Japanese for \"man of iron\". A mysterious robot, Lux specializes in heavy attacks. While he shares many of his characteristics with Lux from The 7th Saga, there is no known relationship between the two. He can equip iron fists and iron armor exclusive to him.</p><h4>8) Tokio the Ninja</h4><p>A speedy ninja, he gains several useful abilities, like a double hit and a power-boosting yell. He can equip the same heavy armor as the Heroes and he is proficient in the use of most weapons; in particular, he's the only character proficient in the use of sabers and bows. (<em>He is different from any of the seven characters in the 7th Saga.</em>)</p><h2>Arks</h2><p>Throughout the game, the player acquires magical objects called Arks. The Arks are like fairies, able to impart their powers onto objects, something the player must do to solve various puzzles in the game. They also represent the scattered power of the Goddess The Arks are:</p><h3>Ark of Power</h3><p>This Ark is found in the Sand World, in a shrine that can only be reached after the world is flooded. Along with the Ark of Wisdom, the Ark of Power is the only one capable of summoning allies for combat. It can power things that humans cannot, like rusty switches or electrical devices</p><h3>Ark of Light</h3><p>A group of beetles in the Fruit World have this Ark, and the only way to get it is to beat them. In battle, it imparts lightning properties to whatever it is attached to.</p><h3>Ark of Wisdom</h3><p>After defeating the Chimera that is terrorizing the Child World, Celia gives this to the party. She uses it to give herself powers far beyond her own abilities. Along with the Ark of Power, the Ark of Wisdom is the only one capable of summon allies for combat. Its wisdom allows unreadable texts to become readable.</p><h3>Ark of Fire</h3><p>This Ark is found in the Green World, hidden within the underground factory's Hydro Cell. This Ark lights things on fire, obviously. It also gives weapons fiery property.</p><h3>Ark of Water</h3><p>This Ark is found in the Dark World. It simply fills objects with water.</p><h3>Ark of Wood</h3><p>This Ark is found in the Wind World, given to the heroes after they destroyed the Ancients.</p><h3>Ark of Darkness</h3><p>The Darkness gives this to the protagonists after its defeat in the Fairytale World. With it (and the other Arks), they are able to face Black Heart.</p><h3> </h3><h2>Worlds/Story</h2><h3>Shrine</h3><p>A secluded island containing all other worlds, and where the hero's journey begins. Also within this world are figurines of several characters who must be restored to their proper form in their own world. In the back of this shrine is a passage leading to Black Heart, only accessible using the Ark of Darkness.</p><h3>Sand World</h3><p>The player enters this world through a model ship. Although barren and dry upon entering, by the time the player leaves, it is flooded with water. Two groups of cat pirates, the Bloodhooks and the Gumbos, are waging war, and it is the player's duty to resolve this conflict. This requires working for both factions, taming a large mole monster, and enlisting the help of a cat witch to settle the conflict once and for all.</p><h3>Fruit World</h3><p>This world is found within a green pumpkin in the Shrine's kitchen, and all the towns in this world are in fruits themselves. The player must rescue the citizens of the Gourd Bridge from mimicking foxes and restore various towns by planting their seeds near a river and watering them. This world's Ark is in the hands of a group of beetles who torment the citizens of Fruit World. However, after being beaten the first time, a crow steals it from a beetle holding the Ark and retreats to a forest in the north. The player gains the Ark of Light after beating a fox who was masquerading as a beetle to gain the Ark for himself.</p><h3>Child World</h3><p>Entering this world requires using the Ark of Light on a music box in the Shrine's windmill. For a significant amount of time, the player is stuck in a small town called Blind Alley; it is only after they have played with the children that they are able to leave this town. Until the player visits Candy Mountain, there are no monsters to be found, and the entire world is populated almost entirely by children. In fact, the only adult not in the player's party is Celia, a woman who takes care of all the children in a mansion southwest of Blind Alley.</p><p>However, after the player restores the mansion's plaza, Celia starts behaving weirdly; she won't let any of the children play outside or speak with any of the heroes. It is up to them to find out what is causing her to act this way. After exploring her secret lab underneath the mansion, the protagonists find out that Celia is actually a witch and that she is the reason why monsters infest the World. She was working with the Chimera, and in exchange for a perfect body, the Chimera's master would rid their world of monsters. Coincidentally, the Chimera reveals that its master is the one able to turn people and objects into figurines.</p><h3> </h3><h3>Green World</h3><p>Found within a clock on the Shrine's second floor, everything in this world is, at first, completely colorless. Thomas Edison lives in a nearby town, but his only his heart remains. The player must bring it back to the shrine, infuse it into Edison's figurine, and bring it back to town. Soon after, the player must acquire gold wine to give to Capone so they can pass through his checkpoint. However, he traps them in a cave because he thinks the wine is fake. After escaping the cave, Capone, confident in the party's abilities, asks them a favor: find his missing daughter. After doing so, he rewards them with gold, alcohol, and permission to pass through the checkpoint.</p><p>Upon reaching the top of the mountain Capone was guarding, they discover that the other half of the world has color, but no sound. In nearby Duplo Town, the protagonist finds out that the people all speak sign language, and one of them teaches it to the player so they can speak with everybody in town. Soon, the party finds themselves aiding an artist named Pablo with his work. While helping him, they discover a secret passage that leads to a remote town with both color and sound. Einstein is living here, and he has been working on a machine. Although the precise purpose isn't known, it is know that the machine is broken, and can only be repaired with a certain tree sap. Much to Einstein's chagrin, Edison has put himself in charge of the repairs.</p><p>Eventually, Einstein gathers the strength to challenge Edison's role, somehow leading to the repair of the machine. Finally, it is revealed that the machine is an elevator to an underground society/factory. Many of the people in the town are sick because they all work in the nearby factory. While exploring the factory, it is revealed that the factory is responsible for the lack of color and sound in certain parts of the world. Later, the party finds the Chimera, who then unleashes three knights against them. The heroes are victorious, and upon winning the battle, are rewarded with an upgraded key card. This allows them access to the Hydro Cell area of the factory, which holds the Ark of Fire. When they take it out of its chest, color and sound return to the areas of Green World from which they were absent.</p><h3> </h3><h3>Wind World</h3><p>Upon touching a sand-filled flask in a nearby cave, the hero is warped to an altar in this world. People praying by the altar at the time of their arrival believe him to be their savior, sent to repair their winds. Of course, they'll receive the Ark of Wood upon completion of this task. The task: rescue somebody from a cave. They do so, but upon further exploration of the cave, the group discovers a stone with a message in another language (that they can read with the power of the Ark of Wisdom). It reveals that the wind is generated by a sleeping giant, something the townspeople take hard. The night after this discovery, the giant wakes up, going on rampage and stopping the flow of the wind. On their journey to find the giant, the party travels to the top of a mountain, only to arrive at a nearby town mysteriously. All they know is that a man named Curtis is missing.</p><p>However, they find/rescue him in a nearby tower. He was studying the artifacts in the tower when a monster attacked him. When the party finds two books at the bottom of the tower, they bring them back to Curtis for him to translate. One of the books mentions a mirror that seals away magic hidden somewhere in the sands of the world. The group finds it in a nearby cave and, upon retrieving it, show it to Curtis. He speaks of its uses, and the party then travels to a nearby factory. Inside is a clone, who they are able to beat with the help of the mirror. However, after the battle, the mirror breaks. Upon further exploration of the factory, they find the switch that shuts down all the machinery. After turning the machines off, Curtis relays to them the message of the Black Book: that there is a race of Ancients still living, and that the Giant is actually one of their creations.</p><p>The book also allows them entrance to a nearby tower which helps them stop the Ancients from polluting the world. At the top of the tower is a device which seems to control the Giant. When activated, the Giant knocks down the tower, turning it into a bridge to a nearby island. On the island is an underground cloning facility full of Ancients. After fighting through the relatively few awake Ancients, the group meets Kuga, leader of the Ancients. He not only plans to pollute the skies, but to eliminate light from the world. After his defeat, the Ancients are no more, the Giant sinks into the ocean, and wind returns to the world. As thanks, the people give him the Ark of Wood.</p><h3> </h3><h3>Dark World</h3><p>Only the hero is allowed to enter this world (through a painting in the Shrine), and once they enter, they cannot leave until they complete the world. Through diaries scattered throughout the world, the hero learns that others have entered this world, but were driven to madness by being trapped in it. Since the Hero is the only (visible) character in this world, there is little story to it; the Dark World is a confusing mess of puzzles and brain-teasers. The Ark of Water is found here. However, after finding it, the Darkness escapes from the world with the hero and reveals that it grew up there, writing the entries in the diaries and slowly becoming insane.</p><h3> </h3><h3>Fairytale World</h3><p>This world is populated by many famous characters from fairy tales, including Hansel &amp; Gretel, Cinderella, and the Big Bad Wolf. In fact, the King is looking for people to hunt down the Big Bad Wolf. But while hiring the protagonists to do just that, a woman interrupts the King to inform him that Little Red Riding Hood and her grandma have been captured by the wolf. With the help of Geppetto, the group reaches the Big Bad Wolf, defeats him, and rescues the girls. Oddly enough, Little Red Riding Hood reveals that the Big Bad Wolf inadvertently saved her from the Darkness.</p><p>When they return to tell the King of their exploits, a little girl interrupts the King (again) and tells him that the Goblin of Kuru Forest has been terrorizing Tinkle Town again. Again, the King asks the hero to take care of the problem. In the Kuru Forest, they discover that the Goblin was actually a cowardly lion lion. He is searching for a tower in the forest because he heard a wizard in the tower will grant him courage, but finds out that he's in the wrong forest. When the heroes tell this to the King, he allows them audience with the wizard, a recluse who can grant them any wish they desire. However, the wizard reveals that the Darkness stole his powers, and that it is a threat the King should not take lightly. In addition, he reveals that Gretel knows where the Darkness is.</p><p>She reveals that it is in the waterfall to the south of Tinkle Town, and that they need an invisibility cloak to reach it. However, the only tailor capable of making such a cloak is nowhere to be found, mainly because he sends the group on a pointless fetch quest without them knowing it. Once they reveal that the King sent them, he's happy to oblige, under one condition: that the heroes give Cinderella a dress for the upcoming ball. They also give her glass slippers they received from a shoe-bearing tree. Everything occurs according to the original story until the Darkness turns several people into figurines, and captures the rest, taking them to the aforementioned waterfall.</p><p>On their way to rescue the people of Tinkle Town, a Keaton Fox appears and challenges them to a fight. After beating him, they must face a Water Dragon, and then, finally, the Darkness. After its defeat, the Darkness reveals that those who faced it in the past became its slaves. Being the only people to have beaten it, the Darkness gives them the Ark of Darkness.</p><h4> </h4><h4>Mini Game World</h4><p>A secret world only accessible through a tree behind the Shrine, the only things here are two card-flipping mini games; one of them involves flipping cards until the player hits the demon card, another is a simple card matching game. Both of these games garner prizes depending on the player's performance.</p><h3>Arena</h3><p>This world is contained within an immovable sword on the beach behind the Shrine. Here, the player can trade in monsters for special items, bet on monsters in fights (much like <a href=\"/dragon-warrior-iii/3030-16848/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-16848\">Dragon Quest III</a>), or pit the monsters the player owns in combat.</p><h2>Fan Translation</h2><p>Since this game was never released outside of Japan, there has never been an official translation or localization. Due to the complexity of rewriting this game's script and hacking it back in, the fan translation took 10 years to complete, making this one of the last SNES-era RPGs to receive a translation. It was finally released in 2010; oddly enough, a second - completely different translation from a different group was released mere weeks later.</p>",

    "deck": "Help RunMan evade a giant monster by running, jumping, sliding, and avoiding various obstacles in this simple side-scrolling platformer.",
    "description": "<h2 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Overview</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">RunMan's Monster Fracas is a side-scrolling platformer created by Tom Sennett. Originally released for free in 2005, it involves controlling <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/runman/3005-17213/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-17213\">RunMan</a>, an ambiguous star who can run very fast, as he attempts to escape the jaws of the giant green monster who is chasing him.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The player controls RunMan using the arrow keys, with the right and left keys controlling horizontal movement, the up key for jumping, and the down key for sliding. As progress is made through the randomly generated environment, which is tracked by a scoring system, the pace of the game slowly increases making it more difficult to avoid hazards. RunMan can gain horizontal momentum by sliding down gradients as well as vertical momentum by bouncing off of flowers. After a score of 50 is achieved, the sun sets and the moon rises, causing a shift from day to night time and a change in music. Once the player is either eaten by the monster or falls into a pit the game is over and a score can be submitted to (a now defunct) highscore table.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Development of the game was achieved through <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/gamemaker/3015-2912/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2912\">GameMaker</a>, which was also responsible for some of the assets that were used.

    "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Far Cry Instincts Predator is a slightly upgraded port of the Xbox Game \"Far Cry Instincts\" and \"Far Cry Instincts: Evolution\". It includes both single player campaigns and all the multiplayer and map editing improvements from Evolution. While the \"Far Cry\" name may indicate that it is a console version of the hit PC game \"Far Cry\", the console games are more of a re-interpretation and have a much different design and feel than the original PC game. In general, the graphics and textures are more Xbox than 360 since its pretty much a straight port of the Xbox game. The graphics will look smoother and the draw distance and pop-in are certainly better but it won't compare to other 360 shooters in terms of graphics.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Unlike a typical shooter Far Cry Instincts focuses more on a variety of combat, melee and super human \"feral\" abilities that you gain along the way. These feral abilities require adrenaline to use though, which are gained in several ways including taking pain, resting using a ration or by remaining close to an enemy.</p><p>However, despite being a focus on melee and super abilities, there is still gun play, with the ability to dual wield some guns, such as sub machine guns. Additionally, the player can set traps for the enemies. Also, Jack can drive a wide variety of vehicles, in which he can shoot from while driving.</p><h2>Weapons</h2><ul><li>Butterfly Knife</li><li>9mm Auto (pistol)</li><li>9mm (pistol)</li><li>Handgun</li><li>Shotgun</li><li>MP5</li><li>P90</li><li>Carbine</li><li>Assault Rifle</li><li>Machine Gun</li><li>Recon Rifle</li><li>Sniper Rifle</li><li>Rocket Launcher</li><li>Hand Grenade</li><li>Mortar Stationary Weapon</li><li>FC Stationary Weapon</li><li>Blowgun</li><li>Pipe Bomb</li><li>Molotov Cocktail</li></ul><h3>Traps</h3><p>Tree branch with a wooden stick, which can be pulled back and then released</p><p>Claymore mines</p><h3>Feral Abilities</h3><p>Feral Attack- slashing attack that will instantly kill an enemy</p><p>Feral Sense (smell and vision)- enemies are highlighted, and blood and fear leave odor trails</p><p>Feral Speed- greatly increases Jack's speed, and allows for long distance jumps</p><p>Feral Strength- Jack's strength is highly increased</p><p>Feral Climb- allows Jack to perceive climbable paths on cliffs or trees that would be otherwise inaccessible</p><h3>Vehicles</h3><p>RMV (Recon Medium Vehicle)</p><p>Patrol Boat</p><p>Inflatable Boat</p><p>Glider</p><p>ATV (all-terrain vehicle)</p><p>Hovercraft (allows for travel over any surface)</p><p>Water Scooter</p><p>Pirate Boat</p><p>Military Transport Truck</p><h2>Levels</h2><ul><li>Training</li><li>Beach</li><li>Native</li><li>River</li><li>Rain Forest</li><li>Mines</li><li>Cliffs</li><li>Sub-Aquatic Facility</li><li>Dead Marshes</li><li>Wasteland</li><li>Black Forest</li><li>Pirate Enclave: Part 1</li><li>Pirate Enclave: Part 2</li><li>Pirate Enclave: Part 3</li><li>Shanty Town</li><li>Shanty Town Escape</li><li>Refinery Assault</li><li>Canopy Forest</li><li>Rebel Fortress</li></ul>",

    "deck": "A live action FMV remake of the original entry in the Journeyman Project series. Poor marketing and limited platform availability (Playstation and Pippin in Japan, and only Power Macintosh in the USA) would doom the game to obscurity. The game has recently been ported to modern platforms.",
    "description": "<h2>Story</h2><p>The game's story is almost precisely a remake of the original <em><a href=\"/the-journeyman-project/3030-10857/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-10857\">Journeyman Project</a></em>, and its later edition <a href=\"/the-journeyman-project-turbo/3030-19758/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-19758\"><em>The Journeyman Project: TURBO!</em></a>.</p><h2>Full-Motion Video</h2><p>The gameplay added extensive use of full-motion video with live action. Sparsely used in the first game, it became the series defining point in the second game, <a href=\"/the-journeyman-project-2-buried-in-time/3030-15324/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15324\"><em>The Journeyman Protect 2: Buried In Time</em></a>. The successively higher quality acting and voice work would become the source of the relative success of the final game in the series, <a href=\"/the-journeyman-project-3-legacy-of-time/3030-8330/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8330\"><em>The Journeyman Project 3: Legacy of Time</em></a>.</p><h2>Collectibility</h2><p>Poor marketing and limited platform availability (<a href=\"/playstation/3045-22/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-22\">Playstation</a> and <a href=\"/pippin/3045-102/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-102\">Pippin</a> in Japan, and only <a href=\"/mac/3045-17/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-17\">Power Macintosh</a> in the USA) would doom the game to obscurity and relegate it to diamond-in-the-rough territory. Any copy is highly valued by collectors and fans, and a sealed copy on eBay can gain upwards of $100. Extremely limited numbers of the Japanese PSX edition were ever made, which make those along with the DVD version of <a href=\"/the-journeyman-project-3-legacy-of-time/3030-8330/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8330\"><em>The Journeyman Project 3: Legacy of Time</em></a> and the box set of <a href=\"/the-journeyman-project-trilogy/3030-9430/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-9430\"><em>The Journeyman Project Trilogy</em></a> fetch a high price on internet auction sites. Presto Studios made plans to port the game to the PlayStation (with publisher <a href=\"/acclaim-entertainment-inc/3010-88/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-88\">Acclaim Entertainment</a>) and <a href=\"/sega-saturn/3055-3134/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-3134\">Sega Saturn</a> in the U.S., but these versions were never released.</p><p>Due to rights and compatibility issues, the first game in the series, along with <em>Pegasus Prime</em>, were not available for many years, but a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt30yB3dfCs&amp;list=UUJ75ixRaHJv2yxeg1v-osUw\" rel=\"nofollow\">trailer</a> in 2013 hinted at upcoming ports for Windows and Mac OS X. Support had also been added in <a href=\"http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Pegasus\" rel=\"nofollow\">ScummVM</a> for the old PowerPC CD-ROM. A Mac OS X version that incorporated features from the unreleased DVD-ROM and PSX versions was released in December 2013, and the Linux and Windows versions went golden master in March 2014. The game became available for download from <a href=\"http://www.gog.com/game/journeyman_project_1_pegasus_prime_the\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">GOG</a> on April 10, 2014 and from <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/359420\" rel=\"nofollow\">Steam</a> on February 20, 2017. The Steam version added <a href=\"/steam-achievements/3015-3280/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3280\">achievements</a> and support for controllers.</p><h2>Soundtracks</h2><figure data-align=\"right\"

As the game's subtitle indicates, it is a \"kingdom simulator\" in concept and has more in common with the <a href=\"/sim/3025-1032/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1032\">Sim</a> and <a href=\"/civilization/3025-93/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-93\">Civilization</a> games, and the later <a href=\"/majesty/3025-756/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-756\">Majesty</a> series, than with the <a href=\"/gold-box-engine/3015-7731/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7731\">Gold Box</a> D&amp;D role-playing games of old.</p><p>In Stronghold, the player must manage the resources of a kingdom, building structures to attract heroes and produce various effects. Heroes (including Mages, Clerics, Thieves, Fighters, Elves, Dwarves and Halflings) were not controlled directly by the player but rather were influenced by the player's actions and focus.</p><p>Heroes in the game gain experience, equip upgraded armor and weapons, learn spells and assist in construction, farming, mining and combat. As new structures are built, new upgrades are unlocked and additional resources can be utilized or harvested more efficiently.</p><p>The map in Stronghold is a semi-3D triangular wireframe landscape populated with sprite-based characters and buildings. The map is divided into a large number of sections on a grid, and each section can house up to four small structures. Some sections will contain natural resources or obstacles (trees, rocks, water, unusably steep slopes).</p><p>The list of monsters included in Stronghold is expansive, with more than 30 different creatures from the Monster Manual, ranging from Giant Ants to Red Dragons. Monsters have strongholds of their own, varying in size and strength by type. The monster strongholds do not grow or improve, but they will spawn additional monsters.</p><p>The player must construct and upgrade the kingdom, while fighting off occasional incursions from wandering monsters while balancing food, shelter and wealth resources. The ultimate goal of the game can be to gain a certain level of popularity with the subjects of the kingdom, to defeat all of the monsters on the map, or both.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>UFO: Alien Invasion is set in the year 2084, and has the player defending the Earth from the attacking alien forces. There is a squad and base management metagame, with the main gameplay being tactical, turn-based strategy, taking a great deal of influence from the X-COM PC games.</p><p>The player takes control of PHALANX, the agency assigned to take care of the alien threat, conducting alien research, maintaining international relations and building weapons and various other combat items in what is referred to as <em>Geoscape</em> mode. The combat is referred to as <em>Tactical</em> mode, and involves navigating an armed squad on a map, saving civilians and combatting aliens.</p><h2>Geoscape Mode</h2><p>In <i>Geoscape</i> mode, the game is about base management and strategy. The player manages the activities and finances of PHALANX, controlling bases, installations, aircraft and squads of armed-response troops. They will also research new technologies and use their results in battle against the aliens, as well as launching interceptor aircraft to shoot down UFOs and dispatching dropships in response to alien activity across the globe. </p><p><i>Geoscape</i> mode employs time buttons to control the passage of time, automatically pausing whenever there's an important message to see. Research will progress and items will be produced as time passes.</p><h2>Tactical Mode</h2><p>In <i>Tactical</i> mode, the game is about taking command of the team in various missions to combat the alien threat. The same soldiers which have been managed and equipped in <em>Geoscape</em> mode will be employed here. Civilians and other bystanders may be found during the mission, being targeted and executed by the aliens.</p><p><i>Tactical</i> mode uses a turn-based system, where the player's team and the aliens take turns to make moves. During a turn the player can order troops to move around, fire their weapons, throw grenades or use other equipment. Each soldier gets a certain number of Time Units (TUs), representing the total time they have to act during the current turn. All actions in Tactical mode require Time Units to perform. Once a soldier is out of Time Units, they can't do anything more until the next turn.</p><h2>Multiplayer</h2><p>The game also includes a multiplayer mode, which can be played over LAN or an internet connection. Multiplayer mode can have two players play as either the aliens or the humans and fight one another, or up to 6 players can join co-operatively for 3 teams per side.</p>",

X-COM: UFO Defense, along with four other X-COM games, were released digitally via <a href=\"/steam/3015-718/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-718\">Steam</a> on September 4, 2008.</p><p> </p><p>Throughout the game, players will encounter a multitude of alien races that are intent on subjugating the people of Earth. The E<strong><b>x</b></strong>traterrestrial <strong><b>Com</b></strong>bat Unit must prevent this from happening by tracking and shooting down UFOs, stopping terror attacks on major cities, and eliminating alien bases before they can infiltrate governments across the world.</p><p>Bases, workers and squad destinations are managed in the <a href=\"/geoscape/3015-5043/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5043\">Geoscape</a> view, before switching to the battlescape view for missions.</p><p>Troops sent on missions improve with the actions they take and can individually be equipped with a variety of firearms and grenades. Upon elimination of all the aliens on the battlescape, alien artifacts will be returned to the base, where players can assign scientists to start researching different weapons and technology. New weapons, gadgets, and aircrafts can be manufactured by engineers, adding items like medpacks, hover tanks, and plasma weapons to the arsenal.</p><h2>Development</h2><p>UFO: Enemy Unknown was originally conceived as a sequel to <a href=\"/laser-squad/3030-646/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-646\">Laser Squad</a>, another game by <a href=\"/julian-gollop/3040-5426/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-5426\">Julian Gollop</a>.</p><h2>Scenarios</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4560/249827-ufo2.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-249827\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4560/249827-ufo2.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-249827\"><img alt=\"Troops leave their Skyranger to investigate a small UFO.\" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4560/249827-ufo2.gif\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/4560/249827-ufo2.gif 640w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4560/249827-ufo2.gif 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>Troops leave their Skyranger to investigate a small UFO.</figcaption></figure><p>Shooting down UFOs will allow a transport ship to land at the crash site, where troops will be tasked with eliminating any surviving aliens. All missions play out in turns, with the player always going first. Troops have Action Points that are depleted by everything from moving and shooting to turning and priming grenades.</p><p>Alien weaponry is far superior to the the troops' ballistic rifles and heavy cannons, requiring caution to keep squad members alive. Reaction fire allows soldiers to save action points for the alien turn, and, depending on an individual's reaction stat, he or she may fire on an alien that moves into line of sight. UFOs may also land; players can take advantage of this by sending transport ships to catch the aliens off guard. Research rewards are often better, as the UFO itself is not damaged, unlike when alien crafts are shot down. However, this also means that there will be more aliens to contend with on the ground.</p><p>Terror missions are arguably the most difficult, as they occur at inopportune times around the world and last only a few in game days, leaving little time to prepare before the city is ransacked. Failing or ignoring these missions will make the local government unhappy, which might lead to funding cuts at the end of the month. In terror missions, the aliens set out to kill as many civilians as possible, so players must attempt to protect citizens by quelling the alien threat as quickly as possible.</p><p>Aliens also will try to construct bases on Earth, as evidenced by heavy UFO activity in certain countries (a month by month stat page can help highlight this information). These missions are completed by killing or capturing all aliens inside. It is worth noting that at the core of the bases, a high-ranking alien can usually be found who will yield valuable information if taken alive and interrogated.</p><p>The world map progresses with time, and missions can be taken during night or day. All the aliens have the unique advantage of seeing as well at night as day. Therefore players can opt to wait until daylight to attempt a given mission, in order to not be at a disadvantage.</p><h2>Aliens</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2942/380849-sectoid_alive.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-380849\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2942/380849-sectoid_alive.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-380849\"><img alt=\"A sectoid.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2942/380849-sectoid_alive.png\" data-srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/2942/380849-sectoid_alive.png 640w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2942/380849-sectoid_alive.png 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"A sectoid.\" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2942/380849-sectoid_alive.png\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/2942/380849-sectoid_alive.png 640w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2942/380849-sectoid_alive.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>A sectoid.</figcaption></figure><p>There are five alien races, each with an associated support unit, usually only seen on the terror missions or within their bases.</p><p> </p><h3>Sectoids</h3><p>The Sectoids are based on the <a href=\"/greys/3015-6262/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6262\">greys</a>.

Players must hire and pay all personnel and also pay upkeep for various facilities on a monthly basis. Radar systems, storage areas, living quarters, research, and manufacturing areas may also be constructed. Later, base defenses, alien containment, and more hangar space become important to the mission. Management of weapons and ammunition for troops and ships also occur here.</p><p>Should an X-COM base be invaded by hostile forces, the base will need to be defended by the player's forces within that base. Aliens will infiltrate through possible entry zones, like gun ports and hangars. Supplies that aren't allocated to soldiers will be in storage areas. Not all of the base is well-lit, particularly hangars, making visibility a problem. Creating defensive structures and bottlenecks around entry points are ways to minimise the damage taken during base defence scenarios. If players fail one of these missions, the base will be lost.</p><h2>Research &amp; Development</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2942/388637-laser_defences.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-388637\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2942/388637-laser_defences.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-388637\"><img alt=\"'Laser Defences' in the UFOpedia.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2942/388637-laser_defences.png\" data-srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/2942/388637-laser_defences.png 640w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2942/388637-laser_defences.png 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"'Laser Defences' in the UFOpedia.\" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2942/388637-laser_defences.png\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/2942/388637-laser_defences.png 640w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2942/388637-laser_defences.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>'Laser Defences' in the UFOpedia.</figcaption></figure><p>Hiring and utilizing scientists and engineers allows progress in the game, both technologically and story-wise. More powerful and varied weapons are made available, as well as personal armor, building types, and information about the aliens. Psychic research also becomes part of the gameplay, allowing the player's troops to use the alien's mind control abilities against them. The later aircraft are necessary for completing the game, and only by bringing in live aliens will scientists discover a way to eradicate the alien menace. Learning about the aliens opens up new avenues of research, propelling players toward having the tools to bring about the game's conclusion - as long as enough scientists are allocated to the task.</p><h2>UFO Interception</h2><p>When pursuing enemy craft with an aircraft on the <a href=\"/geoscape/3015-5043/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5043\">Geoscape</a>, players may get within firing range. This spawns an interceptor minigame, which pits the player's craft against a UFO. Smaller UFOs tend to be more fragile and less heavily armed, while the top-of-the-line enemy ships can easily destroy more basic X-COM crafts - especially if the aircraft's armament doesn't have sufficient range. When at a stand-off distance, players can minimize the pursuit window to manage other on-screen events (like other pursuit craft).</p><p>On the interception screen, the green-colored field on the far left of the pop-up visualizes the player's distance to the enemy, and the range and ammunition that the player's weapons have.

    "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>In Pursuit Force, the player is hired as the only agent working for this organization. Single-handedly, the player must destroy all six gangs; \"The Capelli Family\", \"The Warlords\", \"The Convicts\", \"The Vixens\", and \"The Killer 66\". Each gang has six missions, with the last one always fighting the boss or the leader of one of the gangs. Each gang has unique style. For example, the convicts are escaped criminals and their weapons and vehicles reflect this, they are crude and poorly made.</p><p>To defeat the gangs the player has to destroy vehicles, people, jump from car to car and escort and protect people. In Pursuit Force there are a variety of vehicles such as cars, trucks, motorbikes, boats, helicopters, buses and trucks. After winning a certain number of missions, the player's rank increases and there are unlockables and more missions available.</p><p>You can also do races in Pursuit Force. These will put you in he boots of members of the different crime families and give you a number of different scenarios to do. While the premise is still the same, win the race, you can ride in a number of different cars.</p><h2>Lack of Sleep Mode</h2><p>Pursuit Force is one of the only PSP titles (if not the <i>only</i> PSP titles) in which sleep mode is evidently disabled. (This applies to both the UMD and PSN versions.) The player cannot put to sleep or even power off the PSP while the game is running. The only way to stop playing is to use the Home button and exit the game. This in turn also means that the player must sit through the bootup sequences for the game each time they decide to play it.</p>",

    "deck": "Deep Fighter brings the space sim genre underwater focusing on full 3D submarine dogfights and puzzle solving.",
    "description": "<h2>Overview</h2>Deep Fighter, a Criterion Studios developed game, puts you in control of a variety of submarines designed for combat. It is considered a first person shooter, despite being vehicular based, drawing inspiration from Wing Commander for the PC. Like its predecessor, you are able to move freely in any direction as the entirety of the game takes place underwater. The game features 24 missions across two discs, and like Wing Commander, makes liberal use of Full Motion Video.<br/><br/><h2>Story</h2>The player is put in the role of a new graduated private (callsign MORAY 2) from the Academy, a training institute for submarine pilots. The Academy is a part of a wholly underwater civilization which is under siege by enemy threats (the Shadowkin) and a seemingly natural disintegration of the environment. Ultimately, the goal is to aid the civilization develop a mother ship and then protect it in order to transport the entire society from these threats.<br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2>As noted, the core mechanic of the game is full 3D motion in a fluid, allowing for control much like Wing Commander and Descent. Throughout the course of the game, you pilot a series of 5 subs and an ROV (Remotely Operated Vehicle) that are suited for a variety of tasks. One of the key gameplay elements is combat, which operates much like dogfights in a flight or space sim, often engaging numerous enemies with the aid of teammates. Battles are broken up by pathfinding, item collection, and puzzle solving, all of which are designed specifically around the idea of full 3D motion.",

Buster sold the cow for magic beans. Plucky threw the beans out the window and they grew into a beanstalk. The story shares with Jack and the Beanstalk. The object of the game is to find 3 items to get 3 pieces of a key. You'll have to climb up the beanstalk to reach a fairytaile world to find the item where you'll have to click your way to find it. You'll hav to find 3 keys in order to get a chicken that lays golden eggs, a huge amount of cash, and a golden harp.<br/><br/>You go around in a platforming stage following Buster on where to go. You have to find certain items that Babs tells you on the intercom system. Find an item and you get a piece of a key. To find items, you'll have to point and click your way around fairy-tale levels like Humpty Dumpty and Little Bo Peep. Anything  you click on  leads to it reacting with a cutscene. find all 3 pieces of the key and you're able to go into the castle. go in the castle 3 times so you can get  your chicken, your money, and your harp.<br/><br/>The game has its Tiny Toon charm as it has witty jokes and puns all around.

A colony is soon established on Mandlebrot and it's manned by a small team of miners using the latest robotics mining and defense machines - the Battlebots. But when MOSES (Multicameral Organic Synergistic Energized System), the colony's bio-computerized operating system, is infected with a virus by a saboteur from a rival mining company, BioMechanical Incorporated (BioMech), all hell breaks loose. MOSES turns the Battlebots on the colonists. The Battlebots imprison the colonists and transform Mandlebrot into a heavily armed fortress. IMC immediately dispatches the BATTLECORPS combat-hardened veterans of the Corporate Wars. These veterans are downloaded into their Armordillo-Class, Bipedal Attack Machines (BAMs) and they must now take back the planet...",

The game has a series of elemental dungeons, where the player can acquire one of four elemental spirits needed to progress through the game. These can be upgraded through finding hidden \"spirit gems\" in the world, often using the corresponding spirit to find it.</p><h2>The Return of the Prince</h2><p>In Beyond Oasis, you play as the ever resourceful, <b>Prince Ali.</b> On one of his treasure hunts, Ali comes across an uncharted</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14912/404159-beyond_oasis__4_000.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-404159\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.75\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14912/404159-beyond_oasis__4_000.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-404159\"><img alt=\"Ali, escaping the island.\" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14912/404159-beyond_oasis__4_000.jpg\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/14912/404159-beyond_oasis__4_000.jpg 1280w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/1/14912/404159-beyond_oasis__4_000.jpg 960w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/14912/404159-beyond_oasis__4_000.jpg 480w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14912/404159-beyond_oasis__4_000.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Ali, escaping the island.</figcaption></figure><p>island, and decides to explore the island's cave. There he discovers the <b>Golden Armlet</b>. Curious, Ali decides to put on the Armlet. As he does, a strange glow fills the cave. A face appears and begins to tell Ali that \"[m]any ages ago, a devastating battle was waged in the shadowlands of the Kingdom of Oasis...\", expounding that Ali must find the four spirits that the Golden Armlet governs, to stop the the evil of the one who wears the Silver Armlet. As the face disappears, the cave begins to shake and crumble. Ali swiftly makes his way back to the boat and escapes, and the island sinks below the ocean. Ali arrives at the shores of Oasis.</p><p>Ali is in pretty good physical condition, and is able to preform various combat techniques, most of which involve flips and spins.

While the world is open, the player may only go to certain places through certain quests, revolving around one of the four spirits and beyond. While it may look small, Oasis is quite a big place, full of secret areas and challenges.</p><h2>The Four Spirits</h2><h3>\"Dytto\" The Water Spirit</h3><p>The ever helpful Dytto can be a lifesaver in tough situations. She can be summoned from any source of water, including spouts of water and water droplets. She is key to surviving the hidden underground gauntlet.</p><p><b>Abilities</b>:</p><ul><li>Pressing the A button once will summon a \"Magic Bubble\" to stun enemies.</li></ul><ul><li>Pressing the A button twice restores a significant portion of health.</li><li>Holding the A button and releasing will summon a \"Magic Storm\", which will damage anything in its path.</li></ul><h3>\"Efreet\" The Fire Spirit</h3><p>The mighty powerhouse Efreet can smash through enemies, and destroy certain structures with powerful fire attacks. He can be summoned from any fire, and, if fast enough, though explosions. Efreet punches enemies automatically, protecting you from most threats. Efreet is used to win the special race, using his fireball dash ability.</p><p><b>Abilities:</b></p><ul><li>Pressing the A button once will cause Efreet to breathe fire, which can beset enemies and unlit torches</li><li>Pressing the A button twice will cause Efreet to transform into a fireball, dashing at quick speed in the direction the player is facing.</li><li>Holding the A button and releasing will summon a \"Melt Bomber\" firestorm, which can decimate multiple enemies, and also set unlit torches on fire.</li></ul><h3>\"Shade\" The Shadow Spirit</h3><p>While not as attack focused, Shade offers a special passive effect, protecting you from attacks and saving you from falls unscathed. This, of course, comes at the price of the SP bar being reduced per hit and fall. Shade can be summoned from reflective surfaces, including Knight's armor.</p><p><b>Abilites:</b></p><ul><li>Pressing the A button once will summon Shade's \"Dark Claw\", which can be used to grab hooks and hard-to-reach objects, as well as damage enemies.</li><li>Holding the A button and releasing will cause Shade to become your \"doppelganger\", which can be used to solve certain \"puzzles\".</li></ul><h3>\"Bow\" The Plant Spirit</h3><p>The hungry plant Bow is required often, to eat through certain green \"caged\" doors; however, he can also be used to attack. Bow can be summoned from tiny plant saplings.</p><p><b>Abilities</b>:</p><ul><li>Pressing the A button once will cause Bow to bite.</li><li>Pressing the A button twice will summon Bow to where the player is standing.</li><li>Holding the A button and releasing will cause Bow to pop, releasing \"Poison Pollen\", which slows and stuns enemies in the area.</li></ul><h2>Food and Items</h2><p>Throughout the game a variety of foods can be used to restore health. These can be found in numerous areas and are often awards for defeating a room of enemies. Not all types of food will heal, however, as fruit will restore spirit. Some items will effect both statuses. Here is a comprehensive list of foods and their effects:</p><p>(H.P = Hit points</p><p>S.P = Spirit Points)</p><ul><li><b>Cheese H.P 1/4</b></li><li><b>Fish H.P 1/2</b></li><li><b>Steak H.P 3/4</b></li><li><b>Roast Beast H.P To Full</b></li><li><b>Orange S.P 1/4</b></li><li><b>Apple S.P 1/2</b></li><li><b>Pomegranate S.P 3/4</b></li><li><b>Grapes S.P To Full</b></li><li><b>Mushroom H.P/S.P 1/4</b></li><li><b>Lettuce H.P/S.P 1/2</b></li><li><b>Garlic H.P/S.P 3/4</b></li><li><b>Toadstool H.P/S.P To Full</b></li></ul><p>There are also summon items, which can be used to summon a specific spirit, without having to use their traditional method of summoning. A pitcher of water will summon <b>Dytto</b>, a lantern will summon <b>Efreet</b>, a mirror will summon <b>Shade</b>, and a plant pot will summon <b>Bow</b>.</p><h2>Genesis Collection</h2><p>Beyond Oasis recently appeared in <b><u><a href=\"../../sonics-ultimate-genesis-collection/61-24218/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection</a></u></b> for the Xbox 360 and PS3. Even though Beyond Oasis was called The Story of Thor in other parts of the world (including Europe), the European \"Mega Drive Ultimate Collection\" version still contains an emulated version of \"Beyond Oasis\", even when the menu still says \"The Story of Thor\". This is easily understandable, as there is no reason to emulate a separate version of a game that is identical. The same applies to all of the box art for the games, which are all North American.</p><p>Freeing <b>Dytto</b> earns a 20G Achievement</p><h2>Soundtrack &amp; Trivia</h2><p>The game's soundtrack is provided by Yuzo Koshiro and his studio Ancient, and an early demo of the game's song 'Concentration' can be found on the Streets of Rage 3 soundtrack, which he also contributed to. Strangely, Ancient ported over most of the sound library from Streets of Rage 3 and while they can be found in the cartridge data, hardly any of them are used besides the item pickup/eat food sound.</p><h2>System Requirements</h2><ul><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows® XP or higher</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel Pentium 2.0 GHz</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 2GB</li><li><strong>Graphics: </strong>32MB or greater graphics card</li><li><strong>DirectX®:</strong> DirectX® 9.0 or greater</li><li><strong>Hard Drive:</strong> 50MB free disc space</li></ul>",
